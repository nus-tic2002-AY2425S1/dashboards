You might want to omit "in the correct format" and move it to an extension. The extension would then handle situations where the command was incorrectly formatted.

By specifying that the event name and date are in the correct format, it might imply that steps 2a and 2b are redundant as:
- correct format
- event name invalid
- date format invalid

appear to contradict each other.

Is this try-catch block (and the subsequent one) needed?
- `ParserUtil` already throws `ParserException` when the parameter values do not adhere to their constraints (such as a `Name` having special characters).
- By catching the `ParserException` and throwing a new one with `MESSAGE_USAGE`, the user might not fully understand why the command failed to be parsed.

I'd argue that a formatting error is very different from an error caused by invalid values entered by the user. Would it be clearer for the user if the `ParseException` from `ParserUtil` was bubbled up to be displayed instead?

On closer inspection, it seems like the other commands that deal with the `Index` object use this try-catch structure as well.

Nope. It's intentional to separate the javadocs into distinct paragraphs.

I think he's referring to functionality of:
- Given an event, what vendors are assigned to it?
- Given a vendor, which events is it assigned to?

This is just for the UI to display the relevant associations to the user when viewing a vendor/event (I think)

The current exposed method `isVendorAssignedToEvent` requires you to know both the `Vendor` and `Event` to check, which wouldn't be flexible enough to cover the functionality required in the UI. However, this shouldn't be an issue for the MVP and can be implemented in the later versions.

Given how `Event` and `Vendor` objects are currently stored in .json format, I'm not sure if there's a method to store their associations without re-serializing the `Event` and `Vendor` objects—which will lead to quite a bit of data duplication in the .json file.

Just something to consider

For `appointmentList`,  are you planning to make it such that the user can choose to also input the patient's appt using the existing `t/` tag prefix when adding the patient and it will get parsed by `parseappointment` and only added if it is a valid appointment?

If not, should we set  `appointmentList` to be an empty set first? So that the `Person` object will be initialise with no appts.

Just a nitpick, you can just resolve it if you disagree my suggestion. 

I know this command is grammatically correct, but I have concern about the consistency of our commands, because for the rest of the command, it is always "company" (e.g. `delete company`) right? 

Unless we are thinking of implement different type of behavior based of the if the target is singular or plural (for example, `delete company` deletes one company while `delete companies` delete multiple companies), I think it is better to stick to the same style.

For consistency sake, I would suggest changing the public variable name of all fields to `value`. So in this case, `fullName` and `date` -&gt; `value`. 

I know `Person`'s `Name` uses `fullName` as its public variable name as well, but to me it does not make sense to name it other than `value` if `Name` class only has one variable anyways.

Wait so currently we can't create a job without specifying requirements and description?

I do think requireNonNull() should be included just to be safe, because theoretically the caller of this method can just pass in Null, causing error when trimming. 

What I wanted to check is that, what would optional arguments be stored as in json if we do not specify them in command.

You are right, now that I think about it, this is probably because this exception is an unchecked/runtime exception and the program is not expected to recover from it, so no friendly error message is needed.

Actually, I think if this function already has two string arguments, the comments might not make that much sense, these are just string comparison. 

Perhaps a better approach is to take in `Job` and `Person` argument directly and process from there, and change this function return a predicate&lt;Person> to be reused.

Actually, this is because Ze Wei had to merge Jun Boon and Alek's changes to his branch as he had to build on top of their code.

the reason is that its increasing code complexity right now. I think it would be better if we just enforced that gradelevel followed a regex of '[Exam board] [number]' (see other model classes for the validation format). If needed in the future, then the granular information can be retrieved with a new method. I think it is cleaner than having extra attributes

Hmm I left it as I was thinking if we are going to have more user stories. But I think we will be finalising probably by this sprint. Removed in [0940d2d](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/pull/97/commits/0940d2d32f5327573fe094ed9ce72fede1f13747)

Since these 2 (DateOfCreation and History objects) are being created rather than gotten through parsing, they dont seem to fit here. Also might run into issues as this method is used by other Parser classes too.

Also remember to add birthday to this when its merged

To clarify - do you want these 2 to be created whenever a parse operation is performed, to like log when and what was parsed? (along the lines of this)

This is a magic string. Need to assign it to a constant like in other parser classes. Also might want to use the other ParseException constructor, ie ParseException(string, dtpe) since dtpe is the cause

Had the same idea, but went through with following the standard convention of other classes under model/person where all the values are public. Had I set it to private my getters would have to be different name as we would then need 2 getters to get the actual priority in String format (i.e first getter to get Priority class object from Person object, then second getter to get the String value) making the test cases less comprehensible, as such decide to go with the flow to ensure readability as well as standardizations throughout test cases.

Also in Person class , the Priority variable is Private final already, so it is not that detrimental to set priority's own variable to be public to reduce having 2 getters with similar names.

When we amend a particular parameter of the Person , we create a new instance of the person as the variables are immutable. If you would like to assign/change the priority of an existing person, you must create a new instance of it with the same variables as it was before with the exception of the variable you are changing, hence the getters. Hope this clarifies.

This allows for partial search if the user wants to search for multiple phone numbers at the same time. So for example, find `p/283 928` will return contacts whose phone contains '928' even if it doesn't contain '283'. Or should we not do that?

I think this is a fair point, we could change it to give a warning instead of outright rejection, as there are cases of customers who may reside in Singapore but primarily overseas.

I think this might have too many details in terms of what the user inputs with the command (like contact index and email address) based on some of the examples we got in textbook and the AddressBook user guide (one textbook example for an action in the MSS was just "3. User enters the requested details." so I don't think info regarding the type of details/inputs is required)

**3 :octicon-git-pull-request::octicon-comment:** (commented on others PR)

I think for the commands where the user needs to add something for an existing contact, need to specify that the user must first find them (the DG task for this week says e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)), so can potentially follow format given in AddressBook use cases:

*MSS*
1. User requests to list persons
2. AddressBook shows a list of persons
3. User requests to delete a specific person in the list
4. AddressBook deletes the person

If you end up using the way of detailing MSS where you have the first 2 steps of requesting to see the list of persons, in these extensions can have instead of 'The use case ends.' something like 'Use case resumes at step 2.' Example given in AddressBook user guide for one extension is:


> 3a. The given index is invalid.
> 
>  3a1. AddressBook shows an error message.
> 
> Use case resumes at step 2.

it looks like you're not allowing duplicate prefixes, so can users not create multiple tags in one create-tag command? if you're using the prefix_tag to separate different tags, wouldn't it not be a concern to separate the different tags and then be able to have multiple tags in the create-tag command?

The comment on the constructor here says that every field must be present and not null. At the start of the constructor, there is also a `requireAllNonNull` that includes the `address` param, so it might be a bit weird in this case

Two ideas:
1. Remove `address` from `requireAllNonNull`. Then I would think that the `address` parameter to this constructor should be `Optional&lt;Address>`.
2. Create a new constructor that does not have `address` as a parameter

Currently the message constant is "The person index provided is invalid". Since we error if any of the indices are out of bounds, then maybe we can change this to "One of the person indices provided is invalid", or create a new message constant

`MESSAGE_DELETE_PERSON_SUCCESS` seems to be designed to be used with `String.format` for a single person, so maybe might want to look into changing this.

We could simply change it to `Deleted Person(s): %1$s\n`, for example

although i approved in #71, now that I think about it, one of the points of using Optional is to avoid comparing with null, so I think that `Person.getAddress()` should return a `Optional&lt;Address>`.

then under that setup, you can use `ifPresent()` here

yep I agree with your thoughts! so just to paraphrase, there should be a

- `String -&gt; RoleType` convert + validity check
- `RoleType` non-null check
- `ModuleCode` non-null check

1. Parsing stage uses all 3 (similar to `Tag`)
2. Constructor uses non-null checkers only because parsing stage will return `RoleType[]`, so it's not possible to check the `String` anymore. I'm not sure why the provided `Tag` class runs its validity checker both at the parser and the constructor
3. `JsonAdaptedRole` should use all 3, since it is basically doing parsing and constructing. However, it seems like `JsonAdaptedTag` does not check for `null` at all, which is a bug in AB3

My intention was for there to not be a duplication of code as aside from parsing the input, `parseName()` and `parseTags()` functions validates if the input `Name` or `Tag` are valid.  

However, now that I think about it, I think that doing so would lead to the `ParseException` error being thrown when the parameters are incorrect. This may not be the intended behaviour if we expect the application to just return that no `Person` was found with such parameters, even with "incorrect" parameters.

As such, I think its fine for now. But side note, I think doing `PREFIX_NAME` instead of `CliSyntax.PREFIX_NAME` would be better?

Ahh good spot, I missed that. Thanks!

But I just realised that this MESSAGE_USAGE is never used because there are no compulsory parameters. 

For instance, `add` will throw an error with its MESSAGE_USAGE if no index is inputed. However, list won't have such a case. In this case, do you think removing MESSAGE_USAGE or leaving it for alignment with the other classes would be better?

Ah nevermind i think this could be a bug. Currently, `list asdfasdf n/name` will be taken as a `list` command. I think it should display an error message in this case. I shall make the appropriate changes

Yes I do agree that MESSAGE_USAGE should be used.

I think the commands currently do correct you. For instance, doing `edit 1 extraInvalid` would display the MESSAGE_USAGE instead. 

An example in the code would be the check for `!argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()` in the `AddCommandParser` class. I have listed the exact code below.

``` Java
if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_ADDRESS, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_EMAIL)
                || !argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()) ``{``
            throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
        ``}``
```

I have made the changes to the MESSAGE_USAGE as well as the error handling with regards to the unsupported parameters. 

Let me know what you think 😄

Just a KIV. In future when we add ability to mark order, we should only care about those unmarked one as it is totally fine for customer to order the same thing again if they like what they recieved last time. By then we need change the MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_WARNING as well.

actually all I meant is to not call the variable name samePerson becuase it is not accurate lol. Additionally, it should be isSameIndex/isSamePerson all boolean should sound like question. EditPersonCommand also never create a variable isSamePerson because it is controversial if it is same person, they just use it directly.

Following the deletePerson example, maybe u can say list/find followed by addOrder because we are adding by index and I don't think we can add an order without looking at list?
since there will be one for find one for list, maybe put one with count one without?

Would it be better to delete the `If the input is valid` part? Because MSS assumes that user is undergoing the happy path and all data inputs are valid, the use case examples on the course websites also seems to omit this part

Sorry I am a bit confused, it seems like previous use cases mentioned error message shown when missing email for contact creation, in that case would such issue be triggered? Perhaps it would be better this issue in two possible ways?

2. Or, remove this use case if this would not happen at all as long as email for contacts guarantee to exist

I think the step numbers are wrong for add contact use case extensions, the checks for valid format & emails are in step 2 hence extensions based on this step should be 2.*(For example, 2a, 2b, 2c etc.) You may refer here for correction:

Personally I prefer keeping the user story but deleting such use case, because user story is optional to implement but use case is really specifying what our system can do and it will serve as a more detailed requirement specification which we would need when developing the actual product ourselves.

I think it is better to change `.orElse(null)` to `orElse("")`, because passing null to `append()` method of `StringBuilder` would trigger the following error
```
Error:
|  reference to append is ambiguous
|    both method append(java.lang.CharSequence) in java.lang.StringBuilder and method append(char[]) in java.lang.StringBuilder match
```
Hence crashing the app. As a result, it is better to replace `null` with `""` to avoid ambiguity.

Ok, after further testing I realized that if the null is passed in as the result of orElse, it is equivalent to `StringBuilder.append((String) null)` which does not crash the app but instead will literally append null to the end of the String, which may not be desired behaviour of our program, so may still be better to fix it

Thanks for the suggestion! I realized that all other classes that represents attribute of a Person has validation steps at the parsing command, object creation and loading JSON data stage. For the `Role` class, since the data passed in during parsing phase and the actual data stored are of different types, I think if we are to implement validations are all three stages we need multiple validation methods to handle different types of data. My thoughts are like these:
1. For parsing stage, the parser just checks if the module code and the roles keywords are valid inputs and then convert them to respective `ModuleCode[]` and `RoleType[]` array and pass these two array to the constrcutor
2. For constructor itself, we can validate the inputs by checking if there's any null object in the given array
3. For `JsonAdaptedRole`(should be implemented for save/load feature), we also check if there's any null objects and then convert them to their respective Model type.
Do you think this approach is sufficient to make sure that the program won't break due to any invalid input or messing up of the storage? Thank you for your time

Hi, thanks for the review! I confused myself with the meaning of `?` in regex and didn't write test case to cover this kind of edge cases. Thank you so much for spotting that! However, instead of ```{``0, 2``}```, would it be better to replace it with `*`(match 0 or more) instead? Because in some rare cases there may still be suffix with more letters and I think it make sense to handle that kinds of inputs as well. Thank you!

Hi, I agree with the suggestion on avoiding code duplication, but regarding `MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS` I think they are actually displayed to the users, and telling them arrays contains null objects are not very useful and instead we should tell them how to input data properly to avoid null objects in the generated arrays. Would you think it would be better to leave the MESSAGE_CONSTRAINTS as it is?

It seems like I can't merge this directly after any approval because the new code added decreased the coverage level of the existing test cases, but I have found similar issues [Codecov test failing](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/325) and according to the prof response, we can try resolve this by:
1. Decrease the the code coverage limit, which probably need someone with write access to help(@weiseng18)
2. Write test cases to cover this part of the code(but I don't think there's anyway to do that, since there's nothing to test).

So, I am proposing a decrease of coverage limit to pass this PR(Since this week is more about tweaking the code instead of actually implementing the functions, writing test cases may not be possible and this issue may easily be triggered by others as well when doing this week's tasks)

Edit: Can refer to prof's latest reply [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/474), I think whoever has admin access can merge the CI-failing PR also, but lowering codecov limit may still be desired if such issue is triggered   too often

Implemented new changes according to @huangjiaxi1111 's suggestions. These changes are finished with the help of @lithops-zty.
The changes are as such:
1. Remove `isValidModuleCodeArray` and `isValidRoleTypeArray` and replace them with `requireAllNonNull` methods provided by `CollectionUtil` class. However, since not all overloaded version of `requireAllNonNull` matches our need(since for one of the constructors we need check on a HashMap instead of array or ArrayList), we have implemented an overloaded  version of `requireAllNonNull` that accepts in a HashMap, this may be useful for some of you guys in the future.
2. Remove `convertStringtoEnum` method from `ModuleRoleMap` class. However, instead of moving this to `RoleType` class as suggested by Jiaxi, me and Tianyi think this functionality actually belongs to `ParserUtil` class(Since it accepts user input and convert it to some other data), therefore we have implemented a similar method called `parseRoleType` in `ParserUtil` class.
3. Remove `areValidRoleTypeKeywords` method from `ModuleRoleMap` class. However, since the new `parseRoleType` method that we have implemented in `ParserUtil` class takes in a single keyword instead of an array, we decide to change it to `isValidRoleTypeKeyword` instead, because it is better to check the keywords one by one and alert the user about the wrong input immediately instead of checking the whole array and then tell user that the whole array is not accepted because some of the elements are invalid.

Should we remove the import, and instead change the comment instead? Because the import is redundant without the comment. We could instead adopt a comment similar to that found in ParseException.
```
/**
 * Represents a parse error encountered by a parser.
 */
 ```
 Another option would be to adopt a stance similar to AddressBookStorage
 ```
 /**
 * Represents a storage for ``{``@link seedu.address.model.AddressBook``}``.
 */
 ```
I prefer the latter, as it removes the import statement, yet still maintains the link. I believe the choice remains with you though, since you're the main person managing code quality. Just some food for thought.

Just a nit, persons should change to students. Although I recognize that many of the methods in this class remain as Persons, which I believe to be a deliberate choice, the name of the class is also called Unique*Student*List, and I believe at least the comments in the class should reflect that consistently, as you have already done for the other methods.

I think the original idea was to have different vendor categories (catering, flowers, etc.) then you can keep track of the category/aspect that have been satisfied by a vendor of that type.

Commit didn't fully explain the changes, besides removing email model I have rename all address model to description.

description does not allow an empty however there's a alternative constructor in vendor model that does not takes in description and set it to a Description model object with string val "-". 
Would like to change this to an optional&lt;desceription> implementation however it seems it would require alot more changes which might not be in the scope of this issue.

This is following the coding style and methods of other Person detail classes. Further, the conditional cases here is to allow for 2 checks for validation of date, where date could be due to poor formatting, or invalid dates like 30 feb, where isValidDate() could then return separate errors for each.

I would prefer making this private, then use IntelliJ to generate (alt+insert) getter and setter. Saves lots of headache if you want to ensure some things (like format it or check validity when setting the priority so that no one else in our group sets an invalid priority)

I will leave it in case we need to test a command that tests the existing priority.

I suspect it still works without `.withPriority()` because the `Priority`-related checks right now do not check the initial state, only the new state.

This will become an issue with `ListPriority` and `Find` when testing for different `Priority`s

I could be misunderstanding this but if `argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS).isPresent()` is `true`, then `editPersonDescriptor.setAddress(ParserUtil.parseAddress(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS).orElse("")))` will always return the `argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS)` value, even if it is a blank string (ie: redundency...?).

I think delete should be another command, reserving the word "delete" could result in unintended behaviors. Example: what if the user wants to create a note with the word "delete"? While this may not make send in a realistic usage, we have to consider that testers will be trying to look for these kind of situation. Thus, I feel that it is better for us to be explicit in its behavior.

The variable name is not the "main" problem, my main concern is the principal "Law of Demeter" (details in week 9 topics). Which states that objects should only interact with objects adjacent to them. In this case, `Message` should only be interacting with `Person` not with `Notes`.

One possible solution is for the `Person.getNotes()` to return a `set&lt;string>` similar to how tag is done.

I think the response for when the list is empty is handled by the `list persons` use case. As for delete, I would think that the user attempting to delete a person from an empty list is technically index out of bound (aka invalid), thus this extension covers it.

I realize the suffix length may be more than 1 for a lot of courses (472 courses in this AY). Among them, there are courses that may be taken by Y1 CS students, for example 'CFG2002ID', 'CFG2002KH', 'CFG2002PH', 'CFG2002TH' and 'CFG2002VN' of the Global Industry Insights series where the suffix represents the destination country. Maybe we can change `?` to ```{``0, 2``}``` to allow such module codes.

Yes I agree `*` is better! Just now I overlooked some other codes with even longer suffixes. One example is the DYOC course from Biz: DMB1201BSP. I am not sure if any of our target users will actually take such courses but let's use `*` just to be future-proof.

@MAOXIONGKAI Thanks for discovering the stem of the issue.

Before revising code, I would like to know how everyone would like our product to behave here.
I suggest the following (Referring to the two scenarios mentioned above):
**for scenario 1:**
Directly reject inputs with at least one empty keyword like `find n/` because it is meaningless. We keep the guard clause within `FindCommandParser.parse()` for this case.

**For scenario 2,**
Allow multi-word keywords. Additionally,
An entry matches a multi-word keyword $keyword_1 keyword_2 \cdots keyword_n$ iff its name $name$ satisfies $\forall i, name.contains(keyword_i)$. In other words, every word in the keyword must be present consecutively in the name, but not necessarily as a full word.

**examples**
Name: `Zhu Tianyi`
|Input|Result|
|------|------|
|`find n\ n\Zhu`|error|
|`find n\Zhu Tian`|match|
|`find n\Tianyi Zhu`|match|
|`find n\Tian Zhu`|match|
|`find n\yiTian`|does not match|


Any alternative suggestion is welcome!

I think instead of this, it would be more beneficial to create a `getClaim()` method using the claim id string. This would also handle cases such as invalid claims more efficiently without checking for specific edge cases. What do you think?

oh yeah that works also but before seeing this i implemented mine abit differently cause of the following edge cases:

input "120.000" becomes 120000 instead of 12000
input "120.0" becomes "1200" instead of 12000

i split the string based on the dot and parsed each part differently like so:

```java
try ``{``
            int centsInADollar = 100;
            int claimAmountDollars = Integer.parseInt(claimAmount.trim().split("\\.")[0]);
            if (claimAmount.trim().split("\\.")[1].length() > 2) ``{``
                throw new ParseException(MESSAGE_INVALID_CENTS);
            ``}``
            int claimAmountCents = Integer.parseInt(claimAmount.trim().split("\\.")[1]);
            claimAmountInt = claimAmountDollars * centsInADollar + claimAmountCents;
        ``}`` catch (NumberFormatException e) ``{``

This issue has been fixed. However, if requirements/description is too long and the GUI isn't expanded, some of the words are hidden until you scroll horizontally. 

Also, within the `JobCard`, a minor aesthetic change can be implemented so that it displays $2500 instead of 2500, but I didn't include it in this PR for now. See if this 'fix' is wanted.

I'll be honest, I have no idea why `requireNonNull()` is utilized, as including it or not doesn't result in the app breaking (and the displayed text is the same). I mainly added it to be consistent with the existing code base. 

 Prior to calling the methods in `parserUtil`, usually the input goes through `ArgMultiMap`, where we then use `ArgMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX).get()`. However, `getValue(PREFIX)`, in the event a PREFIX doesn't exist, returns an `Optional.empty()` and calling `get()` on that returns an `Exception`, so perhaps it has something to do with that? 

An alternative explanation could also be that this `requireNonNull()` serves as an `assert` statement.

Oh that was what you meant XD. 

Yea, I have identified that as a bug but also at the same time, it is also because I am currently using `requirements` and `description` which might be replaced by `tags`. So I'm holding off on fixing the bug until I am clearer on what the feature spec should be.

Marking this as resolved for now.

I see, so really the 2 parameters `exit` and `showHelp` seem to just be for the `exit` and `help` command.

I believe your PR is forked off one of the 2 earliest PRs, so it reflects 30 changed files, which makes it hard to do a review.  

**After the earlier PRs are merged**, I recommend this next series of steps. If I made any mistake and there are other alternatives, please sound out! 

Note that I am assuming terminal usage within IDEA and not SourceTree. 

1. Pull from this repo to your local master branch (`git pull remote master`), this command might not work if you did not set your upstream to be this repo
2. Change to your working branch (`git checkout branch-delete-company`)
3. Merge your local master branch to your working branch (`git merge --no-ff master`)
4. Resolve any merge conflicts that arise
5. After the merge is complete, push your working branch to your own repo (`git push origin branch-delete-company`)
6. There is a chance that the files changes might still be 30, as was the case with one of my closed PRs. In that case, close this PR and open a new one, and it should reflect the actual changed files.

I have completed this, in my branch - `branch-delete-job`, which utilises the "delete_job" format. However, as I noted that we might want to implement "delete &lt;Mode>" instead, I held off on the PR for this round and await the next one.

This might be a source of errors - if `numOfAttendees` is 0, then `sortedAttendees.get(i)` might return null and lead to null pointer exception

Maybe we should check for `i &lt; min(2, numOfAttendees)` instead?

Also, if there are no attendees, let's put "No attendees" for the string to display

I would say, for better readability, perhaps we can create an anonymous inner class of `PersonSelectionHandler` instead of using a method reference on `MainWindow` so that it's immediately clear that we are passing in a handler to `PersonListPanel` in its constructor. 

Reason being is that, it complicates the responsibility of `MainWindow`. If we think of `MainWindow` as just the container for everything else which is responsible for the initialization of the other UI components i.e. `fillInnerParts()` and other functions `handleHelp()`, `handleExit()`, it's not immediately obvious that it also has a handler function that needs to be passed into `PersonListPanel`. Even if it did have a handler, it should be named something along the lines of `handlePersonSelected` instead of `displayPersonDetails`. 

`displayPersonDetails` makes it seem like the `MainWindow` is displaying the person's details, when it's actually the `PersonDetailView` doing so.

We don't have to change it because looking at it again, I think a method reference is fine since it's concise and does the job. But if we add more responsibility to a class, we should be clear about whether it's a callback handler or if it is literally performing the task that's described by the function name.

Hi! I was looking at our TierEnum, we actually have:

```
public enum TierEnum ``{``
    GOLD,
    SILVER,
    BRONZE,
    REJECT,
    NA
``}``
```

The NA enum value likely addresses our need for handling users without a specific tier. This built-in solution should resolve the filtering issue you mentioned. However we might want to confirm if NA is used for users without an assigned tier.

If these points check out, I think we then shouldn't need additional logic for empty tiers. @itsme-zeix

> LGTM! One nit comment easy fix. Handling duplicates and corruption works fine from my testing, but in the future we should add a message upon boot up to inform the user that data has been tampered with. Otherwise, the user will lose data (upon making changes) and wouldn't know it. Maybe can add this is a later milestone.

Thanks for the suggestion! Actually this has been implemented in the form of logs. If you are referring to the GUI, then yes we definitely can explore that.

I missed this in my part as well. When birthday, or remark in my case, is not null but empty a new instance of empty is created, instead of the EMPTY singleton. I will modify the handling of remark in the next pr, but itd be great if you can do this as well.

final Birthday modelBirthday = birthday == "" ? EMPTY_BIRTHDAY : new Birthday(birthday);

I agree, addressing this in PR #96 as well, in the parser, we should allow for input in the form of 30.15 (as in $30.15) and convert it to integer 3015. It's more intuitive for the user to enter the amount that way.

Corresponding to comments in #95, I think we should change the handling here to allow for inputs of "30.15" form, without dollar signs, instead of forcing user to enter integer amount. I suggest to use a String method like .replace(".","") to convert "30.15" to "3015" and parse it as int. If anyone has a better suggestion, please comment too!

Can we just use claimAmountCents as calculated below already? I think its abit confusing to the reader what `claimAmount.trim().split("\\.")[1].length()` means. In the future, we could abstract it out as a method to avoid magic literals like 2, but this is just a nitpick. E.g. `if (Claim.isNotValidCents(claimAmountCents)) ``{````}``` but I'm not sure which is the best class to handle it.

With regards to the error message, might want to look into text formatting of the "..." snippet after the tag portion, as the "..." appears after remark as well.

I'm able to add and edit remarks using the remark command (first 2 pictures below). For the second picture where I edited the remark, do you think it would be better/clearer for the user if we use "Edited remark..."
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4526c5e-861a-4b8e-aeba-a3672c2ff1e7)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d77dcf0c-f85c-412f-a528-469ddc29fa6a)

However, I was unable to edit the remark via the edit command. Additionally, the remark command does not appear in the example parameters (see picture below).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9fb5da5-abb8-4aea-b81e-7923408591d0)

However, I acknowledge in the remark error message, it says that the remark command "Edits or adds a remark to the customer" so I guess from the first two pictures shows that it works, but it may be a little weird if the edit command can't edit a remark.

Up for discussion though!

findtag does not seem to be able to work with case insensitivity. I tried to input the command "findtag hdb" but it does not show the correct result (second screenshot). All other functionality looks like it works from my light testing.

I did look through the `DeveloperGuide.md` and found that the links were still relevant, as it linked to [SE-EDU](https://se-education.org/), instead of explicitly AB3, and hence served to explain the logic of our address book to a potential developer.

But if there is a specific link/section that i missed out, do let me know!

1. Agreed with Rahul. Could add the available options for the 3 statuses as info under the add command possibly.

2. Additionally, change this line at the top of the user guide to sound more like our project.

`AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.`

3. We need to update the commands under command summary in the user guide as well

Personally I would retain `tags` instead of renaming the variable to `tagged` since we are referring to a list of tags. `tagged` doesn't quite imply list of tags - I would infer it to be a `boolean` variable (although `isTag` better implies `boolean` i know)

The current logic for `filter` relies on `isValid&lt;Parameter>Name` method to determine if the user input is an acceptable search term. While filtering by tier is yet to be implemented, this change could potentially lead to issues down the road. It will allow users to filter using an empty string, which could lead to Exceptions or match the entire customer base.

I think no action is necessary for now, but I may implement an alternative (albeit slightly redundant) method to handle the validity check for Tier during filter.

Filtering by the flag `rn/` instead of `r/` may result in user confusion, as `rn/` does not stand for `remark`, but `remark new` instead. Users may prefer to use `r/` as it is more intuitive for use with `filter`.

I understand your intention with the replacement though, as having a growing number of flags could make it harder for users to remember or differentiate between them.

Perhaps we could have internal discussion about this!

Just wondering, while I don't think we need to cater to every user's possible needs or even mistakes, if our command is 
`schedule (id) /start (some time) /end (some time) /location (some place)`
then isn't is quite understandable if the user double spaces after typing location? Shouldn't we just trim the string? and thus removing the need to regex the location string of a leading whitespace?

Based on naming convention for test cases, if you are testing whether single function is able to handle the different conditionals, it should have a test in front of it for future clarity and readibility. 
e.g. (from the website Week 3 topics)
@Test
    public void testStringConversion() ``{``
        assertEquals("4,7", new IntPair(4, 7).toString());
    ``}`` 
    
 when the function name is stringConversion(). Likewise, here it should be named testIsValidMajor()

Technically we could just initialize assignments here to a default empty `ArrayList` that way we don't have to add a new constructor parameter. This is also cause I think every student will be initialized with an empty `ArrayList` from my tracing of the code. Unless, you would like to allow the initialization of students with assignments then we can just stick to this.

Do you think it would be better to check for simultaneous timings instead? This is to make sure that the calendar doesnt have too many things at the same timing. For example, we wouldnt allow 'Monday 1200 1900', 'Monday 1600 2000', 'Sunday 2300 1930' since they all share the same time 1600 to 1900.

Currently there is no visual feedback for the user if a person has no orders. Maybe you can add one more check such that if a person has no orders, then it displays "`&lt;NAME>` has no orders currently!"?

I'm following the same form of equality as `EditPersonCommand`, where index is one of the attributes that determine whether two of the same commands are equal even if the index may not necessarily refer to the same person.
Commands only care about whether their attributes are the same to determine equality, only on runtime when they are executed then they determine which person the index is referring to on the spot.

`!argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()` returns true the preamble is **not** empty and is used for commands where you're not supposed to put anything as the preamble.
For this command you must fill in the index into the preamble. `ParserUtil.parseIndex` also throws a `ParseException` if the preamble is empty.

remove Policy should not be done here. Actually, I dont think that we should update the Person fields in the person class, so should remove the addPolicy and removePolicy methods in Person.java. See tags for example, where getTags() return an unmodifiable set.

Actually whats the purpose of this line ah? the FilteredPerson has this line cus when the app fires up, it needs to display every person in the UI. Then subsequently, when user calls the findCommand. It uses the updateFiltedPersonList to update the list shown to the user in the UI.

You mean add e.g. `INVALID_ID_0` as constants in `CommandTestUtil`? I think it's ok to leave it here because `NameTest`, `EmailTest` etc. just use hardcoded strings, and `Id` validation logic isn't part of command logic.

This is called in `EditCommandParser::parse` like this:

```
argMultimap.verifyNoExclusivePrefixesFor(PREFIX_DATE, PREFIX_SERVICE);
```

So it excludes `PREFIX_TAG`. This was meant to check that the user can't edit both `Date` and `Service` in an `EditCommand`.

Additional task:
1. Implement "2 word" constraint for name field. Inside Name.java can replace the VALIDATION_REGEX with `[\\p``{``Alnum``}``]+ [\\p``{``Alnum``}``][\\p``{``Alnum``}`` ]*`.
2. Update MESSAGE_CONSTRAINT to reflect the above validation. (should cover both "2 word" and "special char" constriants)

By any chance, is there anywhere we tell them the exact options that they can have for all the status fields? For instance, for project status, could it be good to tell them up front the only options are completed / in progress? Likewise for the client status and payment status. I think currently, these are on the google docs, but not in our user guide.

This is fine, but does it mean that everytime we add a new predicate to update, we need to update this as well?

For example, I want to create a new predicate to search by postal code or some other new attribute.

Then I need to update this as well.

What do you think about just creating a new predicate for any combination of attributes you want to search for, which becomes and AND relationship.

From a user perspective, it is unlikely that I want to find a USER with specific name OR any user with specific phone number.

It is more likely that I want to find a user with specific name AND specific phone number.

Doing it this way allows other people to more easily extend the code too, eg we can just add a new predicate for a new specific combination of attributes.

We can even perform OR predicates by literally just modifying the new predicates `test` function to evaluate for OR operations.

eg `test( (model) -&gt; model.getphone() == some value || model.getcode() == some value)`

I am curious on what your opinions on this approach are

Since we are only finding based on student name, perhaps we can just put find NAME instead of KEYWORD as a user may misunderstand a KEYWORD as subject name for example. And since name can be understood as just first name, full name, last name etc maybe the [MORE_KEYWORDS] at the back won't be needed as well

On a side note, one highly relevant NFR could be creating security measures around the patients' data, since this kind of information is quite sensitive under PDPA. In my opinion, basic encryption and decryption could be implemented, but at the same time it can also be considered somewhat unreasonable to implement since it is out of the scope of what we're supposed to do.

The way I'm thinking of doing this is similar to the way it is being done for `Storage`:
# Interface + Implementation of separate models:
Add an `interface` to the current model abstraction chain, similar to what's being done for storage:
```java
/**
 * Represents a storage for ``{``@link AddressBook``}``.
 */
public interface AddressBookStorage ``{``
...
``}``

/**
 * A class to access AddressBook data stored as a json file on the hard disk.
 */
public class JsonAddressBookStorage implements AddressBookStorage ``{``
...
``}``
```
```java
/**
 * Represents a storage for ``{``@link UserPrefs``}``.
 */
public interface UserPrefsStorage ``{``
...
``}``
/**
 * A class to access UserPrefs stored in the hard disk as a json file
 */
public class JsonUserPrefsStorage implements UserPrefsStorage ``{``
...
``}``
```
## Merged Storage object
We use these interfaces to create a new Mother-of-all `Model` interface, which we implement as `ModelManager`, which can be initialised with instances of `AddressBookModel` and `TransactionBookModel`.

Here is how `Storage` does it:
```java
/**
 * API of the Storage component
 */
public interface Storage extends AddressBookStorage, UserPrefsStorage ``{``
...
``}``
public class StorageManager implements Storage ``{``
    // Initialise with instance of each storage
    private AddressBookStorage addressBookStorage;
    private UserPrefsStorage userPrefsStorage;

    // Expose all methods from all storages
    @Override
    public Optional<UserPrefs> readUserPrefs() throws DataLoadingException ``{``
        return userPrefsStorage.readUserPrefs();
    ``}``
    @Override
    public Optional<ReadOnlyAddressBook> readAddressBook(Path filePath) throws DataLoadingException ``{``
        return addressBookStorage.readAddressBook(filePath);
    ``}``
...
``}``
```

Sure we can explore better implementation for this in future iterations and potentially refactor the ab3 code as well. The current implementation takes the form from `java/spleetwaise/address/logic/commands/ClearCommand.java`

```
public class ClearCommand extends Command ``{``

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "clear";
    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Address book has been cleared!";


    @Override

        requireNonNull(model);
        model.setAddressBook(new AddressBook());
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);

``}``

From a software engineering perspective, the decision to abstract exceptions should be guided by principles like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and maintainability. If both the address and transaction commands share similar behaviour in their exception handling, it might indeed make sense to introduce a more generic CommandException class. This would allow for more consistent handling and reduce code duplication across different modules.

However, we should also consider the potential for future expansion. The requirements for exception handling are likely to diverge significantly between address and transaction commands in the future, having separate exception classes might provide us with greater flexibility. In this case, we could follow the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), ensuring that the system can be extended without modifying existing code. This should be in line with our initial rationale for creating the `spleetwaise.transaction` packages. 

More importantly, using specific exceptions can enhance the clarity and precision of test cases. When testing, it allows us to accurately capture and handle the expected errors that relate specifically to transactions. This level of specificity is crucial in unit tests, where we aim to validate not just the occurrence of an error, but its precise nature and context. It ensures that our tests are robust and correctly reflect the application’s behaviour in different scenarios.

> Hi @AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/developers, for GUI testing, thinking of using [TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library, then test for each command, the output in `resultDisplayPlaceholder`, `personListView`, `transactionListView` are displayed correctly. In doing so, the testing should go through all the required components and ticked off code coverage issues. So no need _'unit testing'_ each individual components like `TransactionCard`, `TransactionListPanel` that is not helpful.

[TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) is in line with what the CS2103 textbook recommends. Unless you want to learn selenium. Else we can go ahead with testFX

Summary
This pull request introduces an id field to the Person class within the address book application. This change aims to uniquely identify each Person object, enhancing the application's ability to manage and differentiate between individuals, even if they share the same name or other attributes.

Key Changes
Addition of id Field:

A new id field of type String is added to the Person class. This field is initialized using the IdUtil.getId() method, ensuring each Person has a unique identifier.
Constructors of the Person class have been updated to include the id parameter. An overloaded constructor is provided to generate an id automatically if not supplied.
Methods for ID Comparison:

A new method hasSameId(Person otherPerson) is introduced in the Person class to compare the id fields of two Person objects.
Corresponding methods hasPersonById in AddressBook and containsSameId in UniquePersonList are added to check for the existence of a person by id.
JSON Adaptation:

The JsonAdaptedPerson class is updated to handle the id field, ensuring that it is serialized and deserialized correctly.
The toModelType method in JsonAdaptedPerson now throws an IllegalValueException if the id is missing.
Error Handling for Duplicate IDs:

The JsonSerializableAddressBook class now checks for duplicate ids and throws an IllegalValueException if duplicates are found, with a new error message MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_ID.
Test Cases:

New test cases are added to verify the correct handling of the id field, including tests for duplicate IDs and invalid or missing IDs.
Existing tests are updated to accommodate the changes in constructors and methods.
Feedback
Code Quality:

The changes are well-structured and maintain the existing coding standards. The addition of the id field is seamlessly integrated into the existing architecture.
The use of IdUtil.getId() ensures that IDs are unique, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity.
Testing:

The test coverage is comprehensive, covering various scenarios related to the new id field. This includes both positive cases (valid IDs) and negative cases (missing or duplicate IDs).
Documentation:

The JavaDoc comments are updated to reflect the new methods and their purposes. This helps in maintaining clarity for future developers.
Suggestions
Performance Considerations:

While the current implementation checks for duplicate IDs during deserialization, consider implementing similar checks during runtime operations (e.g., when adding a new Person) to prevent potential issues earlier.
Further Enhancements:

Consider adding more utility methods in IdUtil for ID validation or formatting if needed in the future.
Overall, this pull request effectively enhances the Person model by introducing a unique identifier, improving the robustness and reliability of the address book application.

Is it possible to write another method to check for null object in an array(to avoid duplicate codes)?

I am wondering if this Fee should be _abstract_? Or are there any cases when the Fee class can be used directly?
for the testing part, I think an anonymous class can be created for testing non-abstract methods
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class AbstractClassTest ``{``

    @Test
    public void testNonAbstractMethod() ``{``
        AbstractClass abstractClass = new AbstractClass() ``{``
            @Override
            public void abstractMethod() ``{``
                // No implementation needed for the test
            ``}``
        ``}``;
        
        String result = abstractClass.nonAbstractMethod();
        assertEquals("Hello from non-abstract method!", result);
    ``}``
``}``

I think that case-insensitive command words and name can be briefly mentioned. With regards to duplicate detection and schedule clashing, I think talking abit about how it works sounds good, so users know under what scenarios will they encounter these clashes. What do the rest think?

I see, but in our case since we are referencing UC01 List all contacts use case,

I think there should not be a repeat of step 2 saying the system displays a list of all contacts (Like in the example), in other use cases.

> **Use case: UC05 - Add Email to Contact**
> 
> **MSS**

> 4. The system displays the updated contact information in the address book.

as such, I think in the extension it will look like this. I will clarify if this is correct, but for now this will be the changes before any further clarification is made. Thanks for pointing that out

It is just for uniformity, because classes like JsonAdaptedPerson, PersonBuilder, editCommand, uses hashsets for initializing a collection of tags, though it likely wouldn't make a difference if it was changed to a set. This matter was also brought up by Han Bin in the previous iteration which resulted in the change to HashSet

Thank you Minlong for pointing that out! Which do you think is better, the first or second option? 

Option 1:
```
            + "Parameters: n/NAME_KEYWORD t/TAG_KEYWORD\n"
            + "You can search by name, tag, or both."
            + " If both are provided, only persons matching both criteria will be shown.\n"
            + "Example 1: " + COMMAND_WORD + " n/alice\n"
            + "Example 2: " + COMMAND_WORD + " t/friend\n"
            + "Example 3: " + COMMAND_WORD + " n/alice t/friend\n"
            + "Example 4: " + COMMAND_WORD + " t/friend n/alice";
```

Option 2: 
```

            + "Parameters: /PREFIX KEYWORD [/ANOTHER_PREFIX KEYWORD] \n"
            + "You can search by name, tag, or both."

I don't think the implementation for checking for empty prefix values for ` SearchCommandParser` has to vary slightly from `AddCommandParser`. This is due to `SearchCommandParser `having a variable amount of required prefix (we might not always have both name and tag prefix). Whereas for `AddCommandParser` having fixed required prefixes in its command. 

For the checking for duplicate prefix, I have utilised the implementation from AddCommandParser.

I don't think it is needed to utilise parseName() and parseTags() as we are working with String values provided as a keyword here for matching. Or did I not catch how you would think parseName() and parseTags() could be used. Do let me know! 👍

@nigellqx the argumentMultimap::getValue method returns an optional. I think it would be a better idea to make use of the methods provided by the optional class in Java. Maybe you can try something like this.
```
Priority priority = ParserUtil.parsePriority(
    argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PRIORITY).orElse("low")
);

Here's my suggestion for NFR and Glossary
```markdown
### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should respond to user commands without noticeable lag for most operations.
5. The application should allow for seamless data export in common formats (e.g., CSV or JSON) for external backup or sharing.

---

### Glossary

- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.
- **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others.
- **CLI**: Command Line Interface, a method of interacting with software using typed commands rather than a graphical interface.
- **PR (Pull Request)**: A request submitted by a contributor to merge code changes into a repository's main codebase, commonly used in GitHub for code reviews and collaboration.

I think you should use `model.getIsViewTransaction()` to check if the user is in the transaction view. The try-catch block should still be reserved for if the user types the wrong number of inputs. For example, if user is in person list view but types `find ``{``keyword``}```

I found that using local paths causes a bug that doesn't let the image render, so maybe we should use the generated asset link: https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w14-4.github.io/tp/images/leowolf275.png ?

Also maybe we should add alt text for accessibility or see whether there's an issue in the image rendering? Here's an example:
`<img src="https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w14-4.github.io/tp/images/youngseopark05.png" alt="Youngseo Park's picture" width="200px" />`

Actually since there is only one `personList` to store all persons with roles here, does it actually offer any performance gain compared to the `filteredList`, since in the long run they seem quite similar, but I think its useful for now to prevent duplicates?

We changed the format for finding person by nric to ```findnric <NRIC```. The remaining classes were created to accomodate this function. If ```findnric <VALID NRIC...``` then the correct person will be outputted in the UI. If any of the argument contains an invalid nric, an error message will be shown in the box. If valid nric is inputted and no such user exists in the database, "0 persons listed!" will be shown. Finally, if input has all valid nrics but a mixture of those existing in the database and those not existing in the database, then only those present in the database will be shown in the UI.

Thanks for your feedback about the auto-open feature for Outlook! I see where you’re coming from, especially with the tP constraints saying it’s unlikely to have.

Could it add:

Repeat 3a1 to 3a3 until data entered is correct.

Similar to UC02 4a

Or perhaps we should discuss about creating a separate use case for this process, because we will be repeating it in a lot of use cases.

I'm not sure if there is a better implementation, but since Transaction relies on the Person object and the add command uses Phone as input, `getPersonFromPhone` was created to find the corresponding Person in the address book. The upside of this approach is that we do not have to chain address book in the transaction command chain, but the downside is that this might feel out of place since `ParserUtil` now holds on to a reference to the existing address book

Took a quick run through the changes. This is just my two cents, but I think it would be better to build the smaller component parts without adding partially implemented functions in the bigger components with TODOs. This would help distinguish between components that are ready and those that are not ready.

I can see a potential error here. I think we need to implement a prefix to differentiate between index and phone number.

I don't think this method will work with higher number of index such as 2024 because parsePhone check if the digit is at least 3 digit long.

I think we just leave it for now, can discuss further on Sunday.

The current idea I have in mind is adding prefixes. For example, the command is able to parse all the prefixes and the user have to supply a minimum of 1 prefix and value such as delete i/[index].

When the user write delete n/John a/nus lmao, it will narrow the delete and I think this prefix mechanism can be extended further for batch delete and such.

Im not sure if having a link to external application is allowed due to [Constraint-External-Software](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-constraints.html#constraint-external-software).
I think it might be fine since telegram/ web browser is widely available but might be better to clarify.

- Remove the `Score` functionality
- Add a "details" field to the assignment

I think of other implementation, still holds a reference to address book, on interface `Parser` instead (similar to [Model](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/spleetwaise/address/model/Model.java)). Depends on how often model is used.
How it works:
- `getPersonFromPhone(Phone phone)` becomes `getPersonFromPhone(Phone phone, model)`
- `AddCommandParser` calls `getPersonFromPhone(Phone phone, model)`
- Since `AddCommandParser` implements `Parser&lt;AddCommand>`, can access the model variable. The other parsers can use the model variable as well.

Hi @AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/developers, for GUI testing, thinking of using [TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library, then test for each command, the output in `resultDisplayPlaceholder`, `personListView`, `transactionListView` are displayed correctly. In doing so, the testing should go through all the required components and ticked off code coverage issues. So no need _'unit testing'_ each individual components like `TransactionCard`, `TransactionListPanel` that is not helpful.

TODO (after completion of `AddTxn` and `ListTxn` command):
- [ ] GUI testing for add txn then output correctly for both big screen and split screen
- [ ] a test case on `adjustPaneVisibility` in `MainWindow.java`

The handler is basically `displayPersonDetail` in `MainWindow`.

Cause we want to send the `Person` data to `PersonDetailView` and display it on the `MainWindow`. The `PersonCard` and `PersonListPanel` is instantiated with the `displayPersonDetail` function.

This way we don't need to have a reference to the `MainWindow` in `PersonCard` or anywhere when updating the UI.

I think there could be justification for leaving address as a field for contacts, but perhaps not in the MVP. Maybe in the future we could implement it as an additional feature where we can sort contacts by address to identify family members living in the same household for example.

Should update example to use `s/name` instead of `s/alphabet` now that it's changed.
I think there's no need to specify "Optional" parameter here. The convention for other Commands' MESSAGE_USAGE, as well as the UG, is that parameters in [square brackets] are optional without having to be explicitly stated. 
</panel>

**2 :octicon-git-pull-request::octicon-comment:** (commented on others PR)
</div>

I think it would be good to keep the MESSAGE_USAGE. Can be displayed in other cases like if the user gives some parameters which the command doesn't support, e.g. `list n/Bob`.

Though I now realise that none of the commands currently correct you if you add unsupported parameters, whether we should start to implement it is probably a whole other topic. For now, maybe we keep the MESSAGE_USAGE so at least we have it for the future? If we do, we can add in a comment that it's currently not used but have plans to add appropriate error messages.

Let me know what you think

**3 :octicon-git-pull-request::octicon-comment:** (commented on others PR)
</div>

I don't think the `!argMultimap.getPreamble().isEmpty()` check is sufficient to check for unsupported parameters. As far as I know, ArgumentTokenizer gets the `preamble` from all the text before the first given prefix. For e.g. if the input is `list s/name n/Bob`, n/Bob is taken as part of the s/ argument. So it passes the "noPreamble" check, but would fail instead because the sort option is not supported.

Anyway, I think this would require a slightly larger overhaul of the error message system if we want to standardise it, and is outside of the scope of this PR. This fix seems fine for now.

I think it's more intuitive for the command itself to take in a String, being the group name, and only the implementation under the hood creates a new Group with that name and uses it to find the group to delete. If the command were to create an empty group with just the name and tell the Model to delete that group, it doesn't delete an exact equal group (since the members are missing) which might be a bit jarring. @chongsun2002 @Justin-Yeo @zzzlou feel free to chip in with your thoughts

I think both works but perhaps the string one is a bit more intuitive.

As a future developer, it is easier to understand that groups are getting matched because the name is acting as a unique identifier. It may be a bit confusing to see why a new group is being created for a delete group command, even though I understand that the intention is to exploit the equals method of the group to delete the group,

I think no changes are needed here, and we can merge this.

That is a good point, nice catch! While editing this PR, I also realised that another error case to handle is the situation when the command entered does not match the required format. Have replaced this extension with the new case in the latest commit.

Upon further revision, I realise that this PR tried to introduce too many changes too soon. I believe that many of the changes eg. end time, location are useful to have, but should be held off until a later iteration.

Have reduced the scope of this PR to just the name and date fields to match the feature specification for now. Can always refer to the commit history when implementing new features in the future.

Hello, jumping in to check if this we're planning to implement the `getFilteredEventList()` method for the `Model` class in this PR? Realise that this is a blocker for #71. If not I can introduce the changes in the PR for the assign command issue.

Curious, am wondering what else would be needed to support this? My current understanding is that the methods introduced in this PR should suffice 🤔.

Would be tricky to implement this. Am thinking of saving it based off the array index of the vendors and events to avoid the duplication issue. Otherwise might be better to introduce a unique id field to the `Vendor` and `Event` models.

I think for something like remarks a safe implementation is to always have the field there, maybe we can choose to fix this on display side (Don't display empty remarks on the GUI). Reason being its probably not worth the hassle to deal with null values or Optionals.

Currently, appointment is deemed as an optional field, as not all patients may have an appointment.

For patients without appointments, their appointment variable holds a null value. With this implementation, `appointment.equals(otherPerson.appointment)` will trigger a NullPointerException if `appointment` is null. Using Object.equals() helps to prevent that. 

I am also not too sure if this is the best way to go about doing it, can discuss?

i think we should list down all imports separately as according to the style guide. If this is because intellij automatically does combine the imports, try - Settings -&gt; Editor -&gt; Code Style -&gt; Java -&gt; Imports and increase "Class count to use *" :)

Can refer to ParserUtil.parseTags, issue with parseTags is it currently takes in a List&lt;String> which only has 1 string, inside with the whole text after t/ e.g. t/ tag1 tag2 will result in a List&lt;String> with 1 string "tag1 tag2". This gets rejected by the validation regex for tags as it does not allow spaces

A few points
1. Perhaps indicate the successful operation to the caller of this method by returning a boolean
2. Handle the case of either of the inputs being null

## Proposal: Introduce Role Enum vs. Using Tags in Person Class

### Current Setup
We planned to use the `tags` attribute (Set&lt;String>) in the `Person` class to mark someone as a patient or caregiver.

### Proposed Change
Create a `Role` enum (with `PATIENT` and `CAREGIVER`) and add a `Set&lt;Role>` to the `Person` class.

### Why I Think This Might Be Better

1. It's more specific - we'd have a dedicated way to handle roles.
2. Less chance of typos - can't accidentally write "paitent" instead of "patient".
3. Makes our code clearer - easier to understand at a glance what we're checking for.
4. **IDE Support**: Enums provide better autocomplete and refactoring support in IDEs.

We'll add two new fields to Person:
- Set&lt;String> dependentICs
- Set&lt;String> caregiverICs

These will store the IC numbers of a person's dependents and caregivers.

I chose "dependent" instead of "patient" to avoid confusion with the PATIENT role we already have.

By storing just the IC numbers, we can:
1. Save memory
2. Avoid circular references
3. Make it easier to add or remove relationships without loading whole Person objects

We'll need to add methods like:
- addDependent(String IC)
- removeDependent(String IC)
- addCaregiver(String IC)
- removeCaregiver(String IC)

And update equals(), hashCode(), and toString() to include these new fields.

Also, we'll need to update other parts of the code that work with Person objects

While this isn’t necessarily an issue, it’s worth mentioning that `java.util` also has a `Calendar` class. This could potentially lead to naming conflicts or confusion down the line. Would you consider renaming the class with a prefix? For example, you could use a name like `EdulogCalendar` (a bit verbose, i know)

Consider using `List&lt;Lesson>` instead of `ArrayList&lt;Lesson>` when declaring the lessons variable. It might give us greater flexibility and allow us to change the implementation later without affecting the rest of the code. It also adheres to best practices by promoting abstraction. We can still instantiate it as an `ArrayList` or another List type as needed.

It looks good! One note is that the phone number in this test case is not 8 digits long like specified in the feature specification document. 

I actually added the constrain of 8 digit long phone numbers in PR #44 as well as changed all the sample Person objects to have 8 digit phone numbers. So this test case might fail once that is merged.

**Causes of issues:**
in the `EditCommand` the condition needs to be changed.
If the name is modified, model.hasPerson will always be True. Hence, a method will always be thrown.
If the name is not modified, the person will always be set regardless of whether there is a duplicates or not

**Approaches:**
A1
treat edit as delete and add (may break the current test cases as it changes the expected model => need to modify assertCommandFailure)

A2
implement method to check for duplicate but ignore identical cases (may need to make some minor edition to the current test cases)

A3
delete and insert back to same positions (need to add more test cases for insertion methods)

Maybe pass the Transaction into Messages.format() instead of the Person? Because the MESSAGE_SUCCESS starts with "Deleted Transaction". Can consider modifying the message to include both the Transaction deleted and the Person it was deleted from to match the message displayed by the AddTransaction Command (e.g. `Deleted transaction %1$s\nfrom %2$s`)
Otherwise LGTM!

In the original AB3, the find command can search for multiple keywords and list anything that matches either keywords. Maybe we could highlight this feature in the user guide for users because I feel like finding multiple keywords are better than one. Just my opinion though :)

Codecov stated that one of the line is missing test coverage which is same as before, so the test coverage percentage will still be the same (75.49%). Other than this issue, maybe can review and merge if there is no other problem.

This is to replicate the AddressBook.java into the propertyBook.java as much as possible. The purpose of the open brackets as commented in AdressBook.java is:
'
/*
     * The 'unusual' code block below is a non-static initialization block, sometimes used to avoid duplication
     * between constructors. See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html
     *
     * Note that non-static init blocks are not recommended to use. There are other ways to avoid duplication
     *   among constructors.

Noted on this.  The propertyBook class attempts to follow the convention used in the adressBook class where the corresponding error was not handled. Based on the UniquePersonListTest, the error thrown here is to be handled by the caller. PropertyBook wil thus adopt a similar convention.

test cases not edited, will need to do that. Think I need to wait for David's and Aaron's Owner and Pet classes to be merged in before I can do any more edits. This commit mainly allows PawPatrol to understand the new delete and list commands, for example "delete p11" to mean delete the pet with index 11.

I think that case-insensitive command words and name can be briefly mentioned. With regards to duplicate detection and schedule clashing, I think talking abit about how it works sounds good, so users know under what scenarios will they encounter these clashes. What do the rest think?

For this test, my intention was to show that using multiple filters with only one prefix doesn't work as what was intended, i.e. there will only be one keyword to filter by rather than the intended two keywords since the a/ prefix was not specified for the second filter. So it models a case where the user might have forgotten to use the a/prefix for their subsequent filters and hence, the find command created is not what is expected.

Actually, I thought about this while designing too. Personally, I just felt that using the find command with invalid inputs, like those that do not match the specifications for a name or a prefix followed by no value, should throw an error rather than return an empty list or the entire list, because it gives the user feedback on how to properly pass filtering keywords for each prefix when using the find command and may also give more meaning to the find command itself - For instance, without throwing an error, if we permit "find a/" (blank value) , the program will simply list every contact, which is what the list command is meant for and find should be used to narrow down this list in some manner.

I think these are required to provide clarity as they may have ambiguous meanings. 

For example, archive could mean to set all existing information to an archived tag in the application, while in reality it deletes everything and stores the old data. Which might be similar to export but is not of the same function.

Hi guys, sorry for the unrefined state of this version. I'll continue working on this add feature after Thursday. Currently it is able to add gender, age, and details in addition to existing fields.

![屏幕截图(91)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b733f491-fc95-48a3-95b1-a4307336910d)

Next steps:
1. Remove irrelevant fields (phone number, address)
2. Make some fields optional (I think I've indicated this in the code, but there still seem to be some issues)
3. Fix the commented-out test cases
4. Refine the constraints for each field

idrk how this works but initially when i didnt include this line and i tried it out, when i call the renametag command the second time onwards the list of contacts doesnt update immediately on the app until i like click around which was kinda weird. but w this line the list did update immediately so im guessing this kinda refreshes the system?

That is what I am worrying about, I think "by index" may involve some implementation details.

I think that is a good attempt. I will abstract it like `delete contact`.

the gradlew test doesn't allow this tip poping out function to be in delete command class, instead it should be in a javafx file I don't know how to solve this so commented this part of code so far, try to solve it the next time

I think we just tell the users not to use any command that needs to specify the person index in the transaction view.

You need to name the photo `yourgithubusername.png`. And should put in `docs/images` folder.

@trpmy I updated the `find` command code according to your suggestions yesterday: directly use `value` field in `Company`. Please help take a look.

@beginner-web-developer I combined `transactionList` and `filteredTransactionList` in `Model` to only one `filteredTransactionList`. Could you take a look at [#22f5d7d](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-4/tp/pull/66/commits/22f5d7d5426fde86b37dfdb5edab0071758285ca) to see if that works? It works on my end and it passes the test cases. Just to make sure. Thank you!

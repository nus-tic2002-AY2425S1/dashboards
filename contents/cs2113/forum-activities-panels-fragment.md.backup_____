**1. :fas-info-circle: Usage of final variables**
</div>


Hi Prof, I understand for constants we can use `public static final String MESSAGE` (as an example) to denote that this is a constant for better readability and reusability. Occasionally however, IntelliJ prompts that certain `private` variables can also be made `final`. Firstly, why does it do that and is there any merit to doing so? Is it due to some optimizations knowing that that variable would not be altered anymore? Secondly, in line with the class' coding standards, are we required to capitalize these variables? i.e. `private final String name = "name"` to `private final String NAME`

Dear teaching team, as I was working through the iP, I decided to complete all the levels in 1 go and forgot to tag, commit and push incrementally. Can I instead commit and tag just Level 3? Otherwise, I would have to go back to "regress" my work just to execute the incremental commits, which can be quite a hassle. I understand and acknowledge that it is my fault for not reading the instructions clearly. Let me know what I can do in this situation and thank you for your help.

Using the command line, you can check using the `git log` command. The default message would be along the lines of "Merge xx branch"! 

On source tree, you should be able to see the branches merge visually I believe.

I tried doing so, but the CS2113 checkstyle is sounding off and saying I should stick to the regular naming conventions as per what I have I been doing, that is, naming `private final` variables like non-constants. Should I proceed to rename them as constants or would it be fine if I preserved the old namings?

If you're having the following trouble and have tried all the usual methods, here's a workaround:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5e0844b-a0aa-4b8c-a7ee-e4f8e9d3c398)

Using PAT (Personal Access Token) to push new commits on your repo.
1. **Create Your PAT**: Follow the instructions in this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic).
2. **Store Your PAT**: Copy your token and save it securely on your computer.
3. **Update Your Remote URL**: Open your repo in Git Bash and run the following command:
`git remote set-url origin https://&lt;USERNAME>:&lt;PAT>@github.com/&lt;USERNAME>/&lt;REPO NAME>.git`

I'm still working on a permanent solution to this problem. If anyone has any suggestions or clues, please let me know. Thank you!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Making changes to code after pushing tags**
</div>

I have completed my iP part for the week 3 but i realised i need to make some changes to one of the tags. So do i just make the changes and push to github wihtout tagging or do i have to edit the commit which the tag is linked to?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Problem regarding late tagging for iP**
</div>

So the deadline for level-4 iP is last week, and I have push all of the code for week 4 iP before that deadline. However, when I checked today, the tag for level-4 and A-CodeQuality disappeared from my commit. I have push back the tag today but my tracking is red now, is there any way for me to solve that?

I have the same problem too, for now I'll probably just create a rule for Outlook to move invitations to a folder/subfolder.

FYI, create a new folder on Outlook, go to ```Settings -&gt; Rules -&gt; Add new rule```. Filter all emails from noreply@archipelago.rocks and remember to tick "Run rule now" (Modify the exception and different settings if you want). Then ```Save```.

All the invitation emails should go to the folder you've created, just remember to pin or put it somewhere for you to know if there is any update.

Hello!

As part of the iP for this week, do we create the branch-A-Packages off our master branch or the newly created branch-Level-5?

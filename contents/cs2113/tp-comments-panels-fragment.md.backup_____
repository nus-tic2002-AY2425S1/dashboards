Test thus far:
- I commented out the line `System.setOut(new PrintStream(System.out, true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))` from Ui.java
- First 2 updates to the gradle.yml file still did not manage to get CI checks to pass
- Last update: I updated the .yml file to ensure that the correct encoding environment is passed to Windows when running the tests and all checks are passing.
- Further tests/confirmation required.

- After tidying up the gradle.yml file, the CI checks seem to be doing well. 
- Need final confirmation on whether the source code run fine without `System.setOut(new PrintStream(System.out, true, StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`. 
- On my end, when I extract the .jar file to a new folder and run it in terminal, the printing seems fine
- When I run it in Intellij, the printing of table is filled with `?` (Is there any config (VM options?) that was previously changed and need to revert back now?)

I can't fix this bug, we probably have to make the user 

1. get out of the app using `exit`
2. run `chcp 65001` to change to UTF-8 encoding
3. run `java -jar FindOurSEP.jar` to get back in

This should probably be done at a later stage when we implement file reading and storage systems, so that the user does not lose their data when relogging into the application.

Perhaps the checking of equivalent deadlines might not be necessary? I am concerned about potentially being able to add duplicate mangas from the command line since two `Manga`s are considered different if they have different deadlines. Testing is needed to confirm this.

Perhaps it isn't necessary for the actual deadline to be explicitly mentioned when we want to delete a deadline. A change in the `validateArguments` might be needed for this. So ideally, a command to delete a deadline would look like `delete -a "Akutami" -m "Kaisen" -d`.

Edit: This is just me thinking about implementation details, but a suggestion I have about implementing this is in the `DELETE` switch case we update the options for `-d` to not require an argument and add a `isDelete` flag in `validateArguments` to bypass the check for a quoted argument following `-d`. Might not be the cleanest implementation. To be further discussed!

Put showHistory() function contents into toString(). The intention with writing toString() here with the "History" placeholder was to fill in with your history printing. Rationale for this is that toString() is a standardized way to say that the function represents the class as a string, making it easier to integrate.

I don't fully agree with you. `size()` does the same thing as the underlying method of the `ArrayList`. I think what we can do it have `AuthorList` extend `ArrayList&lt;Author>`, like how I did it in my iP: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0656a3d-2fd2-4cf9-befc-a048e569a122)

The branch `branch-test-rebase` was created before changes from #16 are merged into the upstream, and by extension my fork's master branch. Test commits will be made on it. Once the changes from #16 are merged, I will try the proposed rebase-based workflow above and see if there are any issues.

Ok from my research from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16330782) and [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing#The-Perils-of-Rebasing), I have concluded that there shouldn't be any issues with this workflow, as long as: 
1. the branch isn't pushed onto your own fork before you rebase, or
2. the branch is pushed onto your own fork, but no one has cloned it to do work on it. 

For `2.`, a `git push --force-with-lease` is required to override the base of the fork on the fork origin.

Just a heads-up on git format guidelines, the base form of the verb should be used in commit messages. 
>e.g. Add tests, Remove obsolete code, Fix bugs

I think it's fine for now, no need to go back to change, but keep this in mind for future commits just for this course!

However, I think we should still keep the check, just for later iterations.

A new copy of the list can be useful if we do implement a feature in the future that is able to revert any changes. However, if we would want to consistently run multiple allocation rounds, perhaps modifying the original list might be better for memory purposes

Would it be better if we interchanged the names of the 'index' and 'id' variables here ? because the user will be referring to the id of the internship in their argument right ? And while deleting the internship, we'll refer to the actual index of the internship in the array which is (id - 1). Let me know if my understanding is correct because I just went through all the code you committed bro haha

I think the formatter should be passed in as an argument in these 2 lines as well right (so as to handle the default case where no -from and -to flags are provided by the user) ?

Looks good overall but wouldn't it be better if instead of setStatus(status) on line 50, we call the new updateStatus(status) function which you have implemented ? In this way, we can check for the invalid input cases also when setting the status. I will merge the changes now but I shall change this line in my next pull request if you give me the permission to do so, thanks !

Sorry, my auto formatter seems to have done some unnecessary changes to the format of the code in the Internship class file. Do change it back to how it was previously if you want or let me know if you want me to change it, thanks ! I couldn't find any functional issues with the code though, seems to work fine for most ideal cases.

Please do take a look at the commit message in the commit hash a4acd2f where I have went over all the changes made in this pr. Have not focused too much on the coding style in this pr and have not addressed the suggestions given in the previous pr yet. Will make the necessary refactoring changes and add the JavaDoc comments in the next pr. Do take note of the Example Test Run file under the test folder to get an idea of the expected input and output. Thanks !

- Adding calories and meals is done. 
Note: Instead of using a second calorie class and duplicating code from the meal class, I made the name of a meal `Optional&lt;String>`. The `MealEntry` class inherits from the `Meal` class. This way we do not need two distinct objects for tracking meal entries with and without a name. 
- To track calorie history meals are added into a `mealEntries` instance of `MealEntriesList`. To implement the deletion you can simply add the command to the `MealEntriesList` class or preferably in its superclass `MealList`. Then implement the logic when the deletion is conducted in the `ChatParser` class.

could we store phoneNumber as a string?

because the user inputs phone number as a string,

if we store phoneNumber initially as int, we will need to convert user input from string to int.

If it exists call `getPasswordHashFromStorage` and return. Then, use try-catch afterwards and initialise passwordHash with `Login().createNewUser`. directly.

im not sure whether we should bring in a new package when floats or doubles would probably suffice for two decimal points which we will likely not do any arithmetic calculations to alter the values, likely only comparison is necessary which to and there are ways to compare accurately as well like

```

public class FloatComparison ``{``
    public static boolean areEqual(float num1, float num2, float epsilon) ``{``
        return Math.abs(num1 - num2) < epsilon;
    ``}``

    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        float num1 = 1.2345f;
        float num2 = 1.2346f;

        // Use a small epsilon, e.g., 0.01f for two decimal places
        float epsilon = 0.01f;

        if (areEqual(num1, num2, epsilon)) ``{``
            System.out.println("The numbers are equal up to two decimal places.");
        ``}`` else ``{``

I think assertions are unnecessary for the list command since it involves straightforward data retrieval and display, not input validation or state changes. There is no risk of invalid or unexpected data at runtime. Even if the patient records list is empty, it is a normal scenario, not an error, and can be handled with a message like "No patients found."

If the user writes something like

General concept (from the discussions)
1. We implement JUnit tests using existing error handling practices
2. We make new PRs implementing error handling using WheresMyMoneyException and modify JUnit tests to support those

Will push this back to v2.0 to give us more time to refactor the code and get it stable in v1.0

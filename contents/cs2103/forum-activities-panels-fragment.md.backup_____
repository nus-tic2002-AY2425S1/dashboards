Following the [webrick http smuggling exploit](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6f62-3596-g6w7), best practice would be to update the following line in tP repositories `docs/gemfile.lock`

```diff

@damithc should we update it or should we enable depandabot for our team repos and allow it to create a PR, or should we leave it if accessed to not be a threat for our context?

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡Find boolean naming violations like se-red-bot!**
</div>

Everyone got that se-red-bot complain but it only checks some files for boolean violations.

Find more:
1. understand what is the violation: `boolean` but not `is...` or `are...` or `should...` or `has...`
3. craft a regex search to find violations: `"boolean [&hat;is|&hat;are|&hat;has|&hat;should]"`
4. find all instances:

if you're on linux/mac, run this at your source root folder:
`grep "boolean [&hat;is|&hat;are|&hat;has|&hat;should]" --color -r .`

if you have **ripgrep**, even nicer:
`rg "boolean [&hat;is|&hat;are|&hat;has|&hat;should]" .`

Windows: I believe there's `sls` or `Select-String` for Powershell but I've given up on windows many years back. Someone else can try it out.

---

Or in IntelliJ:
1. right click the source root folder
2. click "Find in Files"
3. Make sure the regex option is selected (the *.\** icon)
4. search for the violation pattern

**3. :fas-info-circle: Convention for Field Annotations**
</div>


I have seen #227, but I believe this is only for class / method annotations.

In the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s4.8.5-annotations) for Annotations, field annotations (4.8.5.4) are instructed to be inline:

> 4.8.5.4 Field annotations
> Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block, but in this case, multiple annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line; for example:
> 
```java
> @Partial @Mock DataLoader loader;
```

However, in the JavaFX tutorial, I noticed that the `@FXML` annotations are on a separate line:
([Example from here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart4.html))
```java
    @FXML
    private ScrollPane scrollPane;
    @FXML
    private VBox dialogContainer;
    @FXML
    private TextField userInput;
    @FXML
    private Button sendButton;
```

Personally I prefer the google way:
```java
    private @FXML Label dialog;
    private @FXML ImageView displayPicture;
    private @FXML VBox labelsVbox;
```

What do we use?

**4. :fas-info-circle: 💡 GH Actions CI/CD failing because jUnit tests fail due to missing whitespaces (Multiline string issues)**

Is this you:

    org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <|  Error message here!
    |  Multiline Error Message
    > but was: < |  Error message here!
     |  Multiline Error Message
    >
```


And does IntelliJ tell you to use multiline strings?
```java
final String expected = """ |  Error message here!
                            |  Multiline Error Message
                               """;
```

---

The error is obvious when you reformat this error line:

expected:
```sh 
|  Error message here!
|  Multiline Error Message
 
```

but was: 
```sh
 |  Error message here!
 |  Multiline Error Message
 
```

What you can do is to simply break the multiline string into consecutively concatenated strings. 
```java
final String expected = " |  Error message here!\n"
                      + " |  Multiline Error Message\n";
```

You have better control on whether **the spaces are indentation or intended leading whitespaces**.

**5. :fas-info-circle: Varargs Disadvantage? (Possible heap pollution via varargs parameter)**
</div>

Currently I have a method that uses a signature like `method(Pair&lt;String, String> ... argValues)` where `Pair&lt;K,V>` is a convenience class I have to pair Argument switches and their respective Values

IntelliJ warns `Possible heap pollution via varargs parameter`. I presume this means that when `Pair&lt;K,V>` is compiled, it loses its generic and is a raw `Pair`. But `ArrayList&lt;Pair&lt;String, String>>` also reduces to `ArrayList` during runtime, but the compiler is able to check at compile time if all method calls obey the correct parameter.

Why is varargs unable to determine if a call is passing correct type parameters? And if under the hood varargs `T ... values` are shorthand for `T[] values`, then is there not much advantage over just passing a new array that the compiler would inserted in compiletime, with the benefit of not dealing with unchecked exceptions?

You can use and abuse `String.trim()` function in your code. Extra trailing white-spaces are *bugs with how you code* and not bugs with the testing / diff / your expected code that requires *hack*ing a fix. 

The main reason to deal with DOS vs UNIX test is because the conflicting `\n` and `\r\n` for newline. 

(important because you should squash this bug in your coding before it becomes too messy. You can't always coax the expected to fit your actual)

If you want to use `Commands` as enum, then use a hashmap `string -&gt; Commands`. If it's static final, then it's allocated once and O(1) effectively. Your switch case can take the value returned by the hashmap.

I am pretty sure that the efficiency of switch cases are in that the input is directly used to jump to an offset on the table (that's why we need to break out of the table at end of each case), through `tableswitch` JVM opcode. Whereas with strings it will just run a `tablelookup` JVM opcode to run a optimised `.equals()` for every case until hit. 

I argue that: 

> String -&gt; Hash -&gt; Hashmap<String, Commands> -&gt; Commands -&gt; switch(Commands) -&gt; jump to case

is faster and more efficient than

> String -&gt; `tablelookup` of O(n) -&gt; jump to case

---

I also argue that it is easier to maintain because you can simply edit the text the user needs to input to run the command:

```java
// Commands is enum
HashMap<String, Commands> commandsMap = new HashMap<>();
commandsMap.put("list", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("delete", Commands.DELETE);

...
// input is String
switch(commandsMap.get(input.lowerCase())) ``{``
case Commands.LIST:
   < Many lines of logic >
   ....
   ....
case Commands.DELETE:
  < More more LoC>
   ....
   ....
``}``
```

Suppose tomorrow we gonna **i18n** to worldwide.
We will not want to *manually edit each and every single switch case*!!!

we can simply do this:

```java
// Commands is enum
HashMap<String, Commands> commandsMap = new HashMap<>();

// english
commandsMap.put("list", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("delete", Commands.DELETE);
// tamil
commandsMap.put("பட்டியலிடுகவும்", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("அழிக்கவும்", Commands.DELETE);
// mandarin
commandsMap.put("列印", Commands.LIST);
commandsMap.put("删除", Commands.DELETE);
```

and you never need to touch the switch case ever again.

> > By testing private methods you are testing the implementation. This defeats the purpose of unit testing, which is to test the inputs/outputs of a class' contract.
> 
> So I guess in your specific situation, instead of trying to test directly on private fields of TaskList, you may test through its exposed interfaces (there should be some public method like getTask()).


If  InputState ---Command--> OutputState is deterministic, think about how we'd do it for another input/output:

```java
// testing function "int square(int)"
int input = 3;
int expected = 9;
int output = square(input);
assertEqual(expected, output);
```

So for your command you're testing,

```java
// testing function "oogaBooga(TaskList t)"
TaskList list = new TaskList(Task a, Task b);
int expected = new TaskList(Task x, Task y);
oogaBooga(list);
assertEqual(expected, list);
```

If you do this you **will fail** because by default, all Object subclasses'  `.equals(Object other)` will compare the pointer address in the heap. What you need to do is to Override `.equals(Object other)` like we did in CS2040S. so you can compare if the new state of `list` is exactly what you expected in `expected`.

This will let you:
1. Test the command function
2. Not touch the `TaskList` private functions

If you want to go through the gradle route of checkstyle, you must update the `build.gradle` file to include `id('checkstyle')`, and add the dependency for checkstyle (using the correct toolset version)

If done right, you can run the above command and you'll get a lot of errors, and a link to a generated html file detailing all the errors.

Doing `git push origin :refs/tags/``{``old-tag``}``` (ie pushing "nothing" to the tag) yields the same result of deleting the tag 

Either way is fine

I guess both our tips are better combined as:

1. Removing local / remote tags
2. Adding local / remote tags

Thanks @uniqly for pointing out, in my mind it didn't occur that renaming and retagging are different goals but in hindsight it is, and should be documented too.

Such a trick question!

But to be honest, the question itself looks like 4-space tabs are being used. I think that's the confusion. 

---
Also sure if you're using checkstyle from Google or ide defaults, to change:
1. Indentation tab from 2 -&gt; 4
2. No indentation for "case" statements

Because Google standards, and ~~"nulls are a billion dollar mistake" mod~~ CS2030S use 2-space tabs and indented case statements.

Import statement order is also a bit different. Make sure it's static > java > javafx > org > com > samepackage

I want to add on, if anyone is facing this issue and have correctly set the java path to point to java17, but face this issue, check if the IDE is using the **correct gradle file**. 

_File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle_

Choose `Local Installation` for _Distribution_, choose the gradle folder that you should have merged into your local repo. Also ensure the _Gradle JVM_ is `17`.

**TL;DR** because `*` by default does not include _hidden files_ (starting with `.`). to include them you need to also run `git add .*`.
---

`*` wildcard (globbing) is not a git-specific thing, but dependent on the shell you are running. Shells like _bash_ and _zsh_ define the behaviour of what `*` globs. You can edit them in their respective config / `rc` files.

The default behaviour of `*` only includes non-hidden files, which means anything starting with `.`, ie `.gitignore`, will be ignored.

---

- `git add -A` or `git add -All` If you're trying to add *ALL* files (that are not excluded by `.gitignore`)
- `git add -u` if you only want to add all **currently tracked** files (**This is most often used**)
- `git add -f &lt;File>` to forcefully stage a _currently ignored_ file.

If you're on linux, you can check your desktop environment's Default Association (xdg-mime). Or use a `.desktop` file to launch. Honestly in linux, more often than not it will just open a archive extractor (like 7zip) to extract the files.

> After understanding what I need to interface with the GUI, I've come to the conclusion that my current codebase needs quite a bit of refactoring.

If it's to do with the main loop depending on `Scanner` blocking until input is available, you can get around with:

&lt;details> &lt;summary> what i did basically &lt;/summary>

1. extracting that `hasNext()` into an abstract method in `Ui` interface
2. have 2 different classes implement `Ui`, with the *cli* version's `hasNext` `running scanner.hasNext()`
3. **Cry** for awhile realising you need to implement some concurrency stream implementation for GUI (**This is important** because you know you should not exert too much effort into this but you can't help it)
4. Make your UiGui implementation of `Ui` hold a buffer of input and outputs. Basically instead of `System.out.println` going to `STDOUT` and scanner reading from `STDIN`, implement a _blocking_ function to busy wait until the input buffer / output buffer is not empty anymore and return true (or return false when your bot has ended, indicating a _closed stream_)
5. Run your bot in a new `Thread` so that it will concurrently pull from `UiGui`-IN and push to `UiGui`-OUT
6. Run another loop in your `MainWindow` (probably in the init method) class to run a new `Thread` to repeatably check if the Output buffer is not empty, and then _print_ it out as the bot's dialogbox

&lt;/details>

**tl;dr**
1. encapsulate Ui to be an interface doing the STDIN/OUT/ERR. Cli implementation can use normal System.out and System.in
2. Run your bot in a new thread so that it can _busy wait_ for _Input_
3. Run a seperate thread in your GUI application to _busy wait_ for _Output_ and **signal the main app to add new `DialogBox`s when output availabe (ie bot replies)**

Some caveats:
- &lt;details> &lt;summary> JavaFX updates must happen on the JavaFX line. &lt;/summary> Use `Platform.runLater(updateMethod)` to run a `updateMethod()` that does the `Ui.StdOut->DialogBox->Add to scene` &lt;/details>
- &lt;details> &lt;summary> I had to use a flag to add a guard clause in my update method. &lt;/summary> Idk why even though I only execute the `runLater` when the busyloop continues, it still gets stuck afterwards. _I think `Platform.runLater` might be executed once, so the new thread only needs to update the flag and not call it again. I will need to try this._ &lt;/details>
- Your program will be a bit slower on startup.

Why I did it this way:
- My bot says hello before the user inputs, so I don't want to have edge cases to handle with beginning and replying only when user inputs. Very messy.
- I am programmer. of course I will waste hours automating something that can be hacked away in minutes
- My CLI still works. [Run my .jar](https://github.com/yadobler/ip/releases/tag/Level-10) with `-c` flag to use CLI instead of GUI. This means my `Text-ui-test` still works, so **regression testing still works**
- I dont have to touch my main bot class anymore. All logic remains same. If tomorrow @damithc says the bot needs to run on brain with the input coming from my thought and output injected to my eyes, i just need a new `UiBrain implements Ui` class and add a new method to my `Launcher` static class to create the appropriate Objects for the bot.

I believe both does the work, but if you're pushing to production, compiling **without** the -ea flag will silent all `assert` statements, even if triggered. Throwing AssertionError means in production release your product might throw an error to the very very confused user (if it is not caught or handled). Might save you some embarrassment or tech support voes.

very evil but I don't trust the user to handle AssertionErrors, even though the programme will now be in an undefined state. I guess that's up for discussion 

also note that unless you `catch (Error e)` or `catch (Throwable e)`, it won't be caught. Usually we catch `Exception`s but never catch `Error`s (unless threading i think).

Hello! Great point. I decided to keep the CLI, by separating the bot into its own object, and use another `Ui` interface that determines the contract between the bot and the I/O. Then I used one with CLI and one with GUI and then have the launcher class decide which UI to attach to the bot.

Choice is done with a switch (`-c` for CLI, omit for GUI) when running. If needed, this can be placed in a `.ink` or `.desktop` shortcut file.

I'll copy paste my comment [from another issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/244#issuecomment-2337727375):

I believe it's because of [this line](https://github.com/RezwanAhmed123/ip/blob/master/build.gradle#L5)

```gradle
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.1.0'
```

If you remove this line, you do not need to specify the javafx modules used like this.

However, instead you'll need to list each module's source in the dependency block (ie the `win mac linux` for the base, graphics, etc...)

Not sure what's the difference but they give the same result

@winstonlimjy just wanna address a code smell - suppressing checkstyle warnings

For [this line](https://github.com/winstonlimjy/ip/blob/master/src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fstorage%2FStorage.java#L15) you might want to either use CamelCase, or if you feel it's a constant, then change `PATH` to use `static final`.

`final` alone is immutable but still specific to each object instance. ALL_CAPS_CONSTS are for static finals, which jvm will store separately in program memory instead of in the heap with each object

IIRC usually you declare the variable before the switch, but don't assign it. Then in each case statement you can assign the Id.

I see "Type x = y" as actually 2 different operations, a definition and assignment. So you can break it into 2 statements and then the common statement (ie the definition) will be brought out to before the switch. 

Personally I try to extract as much common statements out as possible, and make each case statement only what's specific to the case. 

```java
int id;

switch (command) ``{``
case MarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new MarkCommand(taskList, id);

case UnmarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD: 
    id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new UnmarkCommand(taskList, id);
``}`` 
```
(I'm assuming `id` will have different assignment in other cases? If not you can also just straight away assign it before the switch) 

But I like the brackets too, they help define the local scope. Reminds me of rust `match` blocks.

Like what @verakohh said, probably if you run using Gradle your relative path `./data/flash.txt`will be from the root, while running via IntelliJ will retrieve the file from **current working directory**

Notoriously, if you're using `java -jar` from inside the `build/libs` folder then it will not find the file `build/libs/data/flash.txt`

If you're highly motivated you can compile a custom checkstyle module as [suggested by chatGPT here](https://chatgpt.com/share/66e3c7f5-97cc-800f-9b03-2335ef20d47f)

Then import it to your checkstyle.xml 

The main issue is that checkstyle does not discriminate between the different case statements

Is CLI ok?

You can use
1. For last commit you can use: `git commit --ammend`
2. Add `-m` if you want to directly input the message in the command, **with quotes**, instead of having git open your text editor (Eg `git commit ammend -m "Fix stuff"`) 
3. If it's few commits down, add `-c &lt;commit id>` where commit id can be found in your `git log`
4. If the commit was already pushed to github, push again with the force tag: `git push -f`

There's also interactive rebase (`git rebase -i`) which is more powerful, but this should suffice.

Changing the if-else blocks to streams might not help if it's gonna be the same _multiple levels of abstraction_ for each conditions. 

Also i agree with @Feng1231, rewriting if-blocks to `Conditional.of()` is not abstraction. I'd argue you're making it even more messy. You're actually introducing **another** level of abstraction, by introducing a new `Conditional` class and running your existing code in them.
 
You might want to see i you can throw the inner blocks into separate methods, and call them in each `else` block. 

Try using switch if possible when there's too much `if`s.

Gosh now I know why Rust does borrow checking. It's so dumb having the generic array casted up to a superclass, and then still be accessible as a subclass.

I assume you're having a factory method so that `Storage` components and `Command` components can create tasks without conflicting each other?

---

Might also help to have it `abstract`ed in the `Task` base class and then have each subclass override the factory method by:
1. calling super
2. taking the _new Task_ and then casting into an instance of the subclass
3. adding additional details like deadline via private setters
4. returning the new SubclassTask

you can also skip (2) by:
1. declaring your `Task` as a `abstract class Task<T extends Task>`
2. Make the factory method return a new `T`
3. Make your subclasses extend `Task` like `class Deadline extends Task<Deadline>`
4. Override factory method in subclass to run `super.FactoryMethod( stuff )` and set a local var to it
5. then add additonal stuff like (3) and (4) above

---

That's how i kinda did mine.
My "factory method" is more of a Command object.

I have a base command class, which takes in the string slices and pushes them into hashmaps. Then each subclass that extends this class has a `runCommand` method that will look into the hashmap for required arguments. This also frees up the argument order, since the parsing method sees the command as:

```VERB [first argument] [/flag1 [flag1 arguments]] ... [/flagN [flagN arguments]]```

<details> 

<summary> I also did something more complicated </summary>

Because I didnt like the nature of only being able to check runtime for ensuring what each argument flag is called. I had the abstract class define a generic `<A extends Enum<A> & ArgEnum<A>>`, and in interface `ArgEnum` i define the methods I want each subclass enums to abide to (ie they must hold a string that defines the flag keyword and a boolean isRequired like `START_DATE('/from', true)`, and then my parser is able to check if all arguments are satisfied, else throw an exception to be caught.

</details>

So. 

1. I have a `CommandBase` class
2. I have a `CreateTaskCommandBase<T extends Task> extends CommandBase` class, which has a `protected T newTask` field for the newly created `Task` object, and code to fetch `Args.TASK_NAME` and `Args.IS_TASK_DONE` from the hashmap 
3. I have a `CreateXXXTaskCommand extends CreateTaskCommandBase<XXX>` which calls `super.run()`, then takes the `newTask` and does things like `newTask.setDeadline(map.get(Args.DEADLINE))` taking the data from the hashmap
4. Then return the task (I use a separate getter so that my `run` commands all can `return this` and i can chain them like stream)

Have a look at #184, there is discussion regarding whether arrowhead-switch statements should be indented or not, since SE-EDU guidelines predate this feature.

Your issue is related to the fact that the SE-EDU guideline, as well as checkstyle, was never designed with _switch expressions_ (ie switch blocks that evaluates to a value) in mind. So consequently it was not designed for `switch` to be pushed in from its statement's indentation level.

So the question here is, do you want the `case` statements to align the level of the statement that has `switch`, or do you want it to be _1 level left_ from the `switch` line's indentation level? 

#184 prefers the latter (what your ide is doing now), but checkstyle will disagree. It's very whishy-woshy. 

You can use and abuse the checkstyle-suppression and intellij-suppression comments to disable checking this block in the meantime, and manually adjust the spacing.

No easier way.

The traditional way (ie with gdb and vim, or with jdtls) is to first launch the java app with the following args:   

```-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=5005```   

you're instructing java / Gradle to:
- run as a server (`server=y`) and wait for a client to connect to remotely debug
- enable suspending the programming (`suspend=y`) 
- listen to port 5005 (`address=5005`)


Then on IntelliJ, you must start the remote debugging client, set the port to 5005, and begin

----


Or you can just press the 🐞 debug icon. Either 

- on the top right
- on the same line as your `static void main` entry point
-  in the bottom under the _services_ tab, choose your desired config (run, test, checkstyle) and choose debug

----

If you run Gradle with debugging, you can use nvim with the dap plugin or any client that supports the debugging adaptor protocol to follow along.

And this includes using things like gdb for c debugging or python too.

> I realised that typing `/.gradlew run` in the CLI will only run the AB3 gui, but not in debug mode. For instance, when I set a breakpoint at the `execute` method of the `ListCommand` class, typing `list` in the GUI input will not result in the application stopping at the method `execute`.

Sorry can I clarify, are you able to stop at breakpoint before doing GUI? (ie you hit breakpoint and programme pauses when the programme was still CLI mode and you typed list in the CLI) 

Expected behavior is that debugging is not enabled when you `. /gradlew run`.

I talked about it [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/255#issuecomment-2342348083)

Final variables only mean they are immutanle _for each object instance_ but making it static final means they are _globally immutable_. 

JVM will store _static final_ separately in the program `DATA` section, but finals without static will still be allocated on heap with each instance of the class initialised. 

---

Now, some standards agree that finals should also be ALL_CAPS. Some don't. For this course, we reserve this to only the static finals.

There's an option in the `checkstyle.xml` if you wanna disable it, for future uses

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡Github pages does not render README file correctly**

As I was trying to set up GIthub Pages for my repo, I came across an issue where the README does not render properly on Github Pages. For example, this was what was produced when setting it up

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b086d4f5-a7f2-45d0-8f24-de4972e39627)

According to [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll), it supports 2 markdown processors, kramdown and Github Flavoured Markdown (GFM) 

Sadly for some reason that I do not know why, Github Pages uses kramdown. This can cause some formatting issue when the page is rendered. To solve this, you can follow this guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/setting-a-markdown-processor-for-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll).

Basically, you need to set up a `_config.yml` file under the `/docs` directory manually and specify the markdown processor
```yml
title: <title>
description: <description>
theme: <theme>
markdown: GFM
```

Even after setting this there are still some format that cannot be rendered properly. For example, 
- Task lists don't work as expected 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35fd8187-2d28-4c5f-b4d7-868d018afc1c)

You can choose to not do it and merge it later on after further commits to the same branch/ when the branch/feature is ready for production.

A fast forward merge happens when the master branch (or any other branch) have not changed from the branch you are merging to. In this case, git just moves the master branch to the same commit as the merging branch. 

A merge commit happens when both the master branch and merging branch have different unique commits. Instead of just moving the master branch forward to the merging branch, git will "merge" both branches as a new commit. This new commit will have two parent commits, one from each of the branch. 

Here is an image I found online that illustrates this 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7168419-24b3-4bda-a8a0-3904ec7a3641)


I guess the only difference here is that a new commit is made whenever a merge is done for merge commits while fast forward will not have a new commit. 

To my knowledge, this is what happens. Hopefully it answers your question. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

If the function call has side effects like changing the state of another component, we can check if the changed state is equal to our expected outcome.

For instance if you are testing a class and you have a function that changes one of the fields, you can check if the value of the field after calling the function matches the expected value.

The issue most likely arose when you initialised `FileWriter` at the start with override. 

If you are not using `FileWriter(String path, boolean append)`, `FileWriter` will open the file in override mode and thus wipe out all existing data. 

In this case, I guess you have two options
1. Initialize `FileWriter` with the additional boolean argument, `FileWriter(String path, boolean append)`
2. Initialize `FileWriter` when the program is exiting with `FileWriter(String path)`

Hope this solves your issue :)

The reason this happens is because you keep creating a new instance of the scanner every time the loop repeats.

When the first instance of the scanner is created, it takes in an input. When ran without a script, this is the user keyboard input. When ran with a script, this is the input text file provided. 

Thus on every loop iteration, a new instance of the scanner means that the previous input stream gets reset and it awaits for new user/ file input. Since there is no other file supplied, you get the error that you see, "Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found". The program then terminates and gives you the mismatch between your expected and actual files.

To resolve this, you can create your scanner instance outside of the while loop.

My opinion on this issue is that if the static method does not have to work with a shared state/field, then yes it is suitable for it to be static.

If the behavior of the method is predictable with or without an instance of the class, then a static method is more suitable. 

> Consequently, is it okay for me to have a PrintUtils class in a utils package that contains only static methods that are used for outputting message to the user?

I agree with this design as it makes the code more in line with the "Single Responsibility Principle", making it cleaner and easier to understand.

This is just my opinion though, don't take it too seriously 🙃

According to this [online](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-java-io-and-java-nio/) article, nio is an improvement to the current io, hence the name "new io".

The key difference is just how java handles the data. Previously it was handled using streams so data transfer would be synchronous. With nio, data is handled asynchronously and thus more threads are free to do other work. 

Another thing that you mentioned is that it would throw more exceptions and they are also more specific. I guess this is better as you can now catch more errors and exceptions before it gets into production. 

Given a choice, I guess I would just go with nio. (Its newer and more powerfull after all 😆)

Sorry I think you might have misunderstood what I meant or I might have phrased it wrongly. 

What I meant was that if the method produces a behavior/output that is the same and does not change regardless of any changes to instance fields, then I think it can be declared as a static method. 

In this case I do think `showLoadingError` should be declared as static since it prints an error message to the console (I assume) that does not change (stateless) 

Hopefully this is clearer 😄

Your understanding is right. 

Git does a fast forward commit when the master branch is behind the branch of your current branch, branch level 7 when there is no diverging commits in your master branch and your branch level 7. 

A fast forward commit then takes the pointer of the master branch and moves it to the branch level 7 commit and thus they have the same commit hashes.

Though I do think that the course specifies us to use `--no-ff` or disable fast forward commit in all cases even when possible.

I believe @Domokunx is right. I tried running your code locally on my machine but replaced `assertEquals` with this

I do believe the reason for this is because you are calling `Yapper.main`. I am not 100% sure about why, but I think the reason is it launches another program and thus intercepts with the test that is ran by gradle. 

Try removing it and it should run your tests normally. Hopefully this helps :)

Try setting your root controller to `MainWindow` by changing to this

Ahh sorry misread the question. 

In this case, you should still define the `fx:controller` to `MainWindow`. As per my understanding, the `fx:controller` is just a bridge that links your java file with the GUI so that the class knows what methods to call.

```java
<fx:root type="AnchorPane" maxHeight="-Infinity" maxWidth="-Infinity"
         minHeight="-Infinity" minWidth="-Infinity"
         prefHeight="600.0" prefWidth="400.0"
         xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17"
         xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1" fx:controller="MainWindow">
```

To then run the program, 
```java
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) ``{``
        try ``{``
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(Main.class.getResource("/view/MainWindow.fxml"));
           
            // Set the root node
            AnchorPane rootNode = new AnchorPane();
            fxmlLoader.setRoot(rootNode);
            
            // Load the FXML file
            AnchorPane root = fxmlLoader.load();

            // Get the controller and pass the Duke instance
            MainWindow mainWindow = fxmlLoader.getController();
            mainWindow.setDuke(duke);

            // Set the scene and show the stage
            Scene scene = new Scene(root);
            primaryStage.setScene(scene);
            primaryStage.setTitle("Duke");
            primaryStage.show();
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            e.printStackTrace();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

> But the requirement is that we convert MainWindow to use the fx:root construct.

This means that `fx:root` provides a way to create the Node as the component we specify and then to use that node as its root. Instead of having another instance node to wrap this class the represents it. You can find more details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23600926/how-to-understand-and-use-fxroot-in-javafx) and [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/api/javafx/fxml/doc-files/introduction_to_fxml.html#root_elements).

I hope this is right, if I did not misinterpret what the question is asking this time 😟

I believe you are using the wrong gradle version as suggested by the error message and the version [here](https://docs.gradle.org/7.6.2/userguide/compatibility.html).

I have cloned your repo and changed the gradle version to version 7.6.2 and it is able to run `gradle build` with no issues. 

The file changed is gradle-wrapper.properties in the wrapper directory within the gradle folder 
```
distributionBase=GRADLE_USER_HOME
distributionPath=wrapper/dists
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.2-bin.zip

If my understanding is right on how JavaFX works, there is no need to set the root of `MainWindow` since it have been implicitly defined with `AnchorPane` in your `MainWindow.fxml`. Trying to set the root and controller again is why you are getting the error saying that the root value have already been defined.

To resolve this issue, you can simply delete the `MainWindow` constructor. Let me know if this solves your issue 😄

There is probably a version mismatch between your local gradle version and the one specified by the project. `gradlew` uses the gradle wrapper and ensures it builds or runs with the version that was specified in your project.

First I just copied most of my own `build.gradle` file and applied to yours 
```java

``}``
```

>[!Note]
> I removed the checkstyle options in the `build.gradle` file for ease of testing. You would probably want to add them back for grading purposes.


I then added a Launcher class at the same level as `papadom` directory 
```java

import javafx.application.Application;

public class Launcher ``{``
    public static void main(String[] args) ``{``
        Application.launch(PapadomApp.class, args);
    ``}``
``}``
```

I also removed the main method from the `PapadomApp` file
```java
package papadom;

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.fxml.FXMLLoader;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.stage.Stage;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class PapadomApp extends Application ``{``
    public static final int WINDOW_WIDTH = 600;
    public static final int WINDOW_HEIGHT = 400;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage primaryStage) ``{``
        try ``{``
            // Load the FXML file that describes the UI layout
            FXMLLoader fxmlLoader = new FXMLLoader(getClass().getResource("/fxml/MainView.fxml"));

            // Create a scene using the loaded FXML, setting the window size (600x400)
            Scene scene = new Scene(fxmlLoader.load(), WINDOW_WIDTH, WINDOW_HEIGHT);

            // Set the title of the window
            primaryStage.setTitle("Papadom Chatbot");

            // Set the scene (i.e., the window content) and display the window
            primaryStage.setScene(scene);
            primaryStage.show();
        ``}`` catch (Exception e) ``{``
            Logger.getLogger(PapadomApp.class.getName()).log(Level.SEVERE, "Failed to load FXML", e);
        ``}``
    ``}``

    // The main method launches the JavaFX application
``}``
```
This is how the directory looks

On hindsight, I should've included the whole screenshot of the table under the pile of text. But yea I did make sure to close the table with the appropriate tag. I also checked and made sure that there was only one closing tag so I'm not too sure why another closing tag occurred. 

Anyways your suggestion of using pipe characters helped solve the issue. It also made the code look cleaner and less cluttered as compared to using HTML. Thanks for that! 

Do you happen to know why some GFMD elements still cannot be processed like using task lists or alerts? Are there solutions out there for this too? I can't seem to find any.

For the first screenshot I think your tests are failing that is why the build is not working. Try running `./gradlew build` locally first or `./gradlew clean test` to see if the test cases pass

After further testing, the reason why the test case failed on Github Actions is due to the filePath specified in your test method.

```java
    public void executeDelete_correctInput() ``{``
        TaskList taskList = new TaskList(new ToDo("test"));
        DeleteCommand deleteCommand = new DeleteCommand(0);
        try ``{``
            deleteCommand.execute(taskList, new Ui(), new Storage("data/test.txt"));
        ``}`` catch (TickException e) ``{``
            fail("Exception thrown when it should not have been thrown.");
        ``}``
        assertEquals(0, taskList.getSize());
    ``}``
``}``
```
The build failing previously occurred when I have yet to run the application before calling `gradlew clean build`. After calling `gradlew run`, the file in directory `data/test.txt` gets created and `gradlew build` works properly, passing the test cases.

I reckon Github Action runs a similar procedure internally when building your application. Since the file path `data/test.txt` does not exist on building, the test case is bound to fail and thus the build.

It looks like when the jar file is ran, there is no parent directory and thus the filename returns `null`.

Try removing line 60 and test the jar file. So then the txt file will just be created at the same level as your jar file.

Update: Did not realize in line 59, you had already created a new file. 

In that case, since the file you created `WindeTasks.txt` does not have a path, you need to define the path by calling

```java
file.getAbsoluteFile().getParentFile().mkdirs(); // line 60
```

When I mess up the task file and enter the application again, tasks with invalid save data becomes null on the list(and in some other cases jar file can't be opened any more due to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`). As a result, I can't even close the application either because the code that handles saving feature can't handle null objects properly. Not sure if this is serious or not...But I believe it is better to address situations when the file is corrupted when user opens the application, just like how we did for the CLI version.

I believe the resources folder within the jar file is immutable and read-only after the jar file is created. Thus trying to update it itself is already an error.

I would recommend just renaming `hardDisk` to

```java
private static final String hardDisk = "./Nah.txt";
```

This creates a text file relative to your jar file at the root folder.

My wild guess after looking at your `build.gradle` file is that the dependencies for javaFX for windows (and linux) were not included. 

```java

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'

A workaround to this issue is to go to the `Main.java` file and press the debug icon (or Shift F9) on the top right corner of the IDE.
Then, the application will  run in debug mode and stop at the breakpoint that I have set.

**11. :fas-info-circle: Suggestions on methods for printing messages**
</div>

Hi! I'm trying to improve my code. I am looking through the UI's printing message methods.

There are two options for printing:

1st:
Having one method for each print case, eg.
'''java
printEventCommandError()
printDeleteCommandError()
...
'''

2nd:
Having one unified printing method that takes in the error message as parameter
'printMessage(String message)
'
Would like to ask for some opinions on which option seems better. Any input is appreciated 🙂

**14. :fas-info-circle: Enhanced switch case style**
</div>


Hi. according to this [issue](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/49), there is a consensus on how to style enhanced switch case, where the cases could be indented

I am currently doing the A-CheckStyle task for week 4. I have followed instructions from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) and found checkstyle errors pertaining to the enhanced checkstyle.
Specifically, this is what that had been flagged out as 'errors'. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ba7db72-2beb-4fc0-8cef-35aa22a919a8)

This is the code that violates the checkstyle 
```java
    public static Command parse(String message) ``{``
        try ``{``
            CommandWord instruction = CommandWord.valueOf(getInstruction(message));
            return switch (instruction) ``{``
                case LIST -&gt; new ListCommand(message);
                case FIND -&gt; new FindCommand(message);
                case MARK -&gt; new MarkCommand(message);
                case UNMARK -&gt; new UnmarkCommand(message);
                case DELETE -&gt; new DeleteCommand(message);
                case TODO -&gt; new ToDoCommand(message);
                case DEADLINE -&gt; new DeadlineCommand(message);
                case EVENT -&gt; new EventCommand(message);
                case ON -&gt; new OnCommand(message);
                case BYE -&gt; new ByeCommand(message);
            ``}``;
        ``}`` catch (IllegalArgumentException e) ``{``
            return new InvalidCommand("");
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

Seems like the enhanced switch case will still have follow the 'no indentation for cases' rule right?

Any of the standard "block tags" that are used appear in the order @param, @return, @throws, @deprecated, and these four types never appear with an empty description. When a block tag doesn't fit on a single line, continuation lines are indented four (or more) spaces from the position of the @.

**17. :fas-info-circle: Confused for the suggested project structure in AddressBook-2**
</div>


Hi. According to the A-OOP in week 3, I can get some inspiration of the organization of code from addressbook-level2. 

However, I am quite confused as it is very different from what we have forked for IP.

As shown below, my file structure is currently `src/main/java`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/873fb76c-f2e4-4df6-b67f-1f2acea05e1d)
Under java, it contains all the java classess that I have not packaged yet.
One thing I have noted is that there is no `Main.java` file.

In addressbook-level2, however, the file structure is `src/seedu/addressbook`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63564d81-f954-4a72-b6ed-eed29111a01e)

Under addressbook, there are different packages and a `Main.java` file , which is not the case in my file structure.
I was wondering 

1. why there is no `/main/java` folder in the addressbook-level2's file structure? Is the `main/java` folder needed for compiler to compile java files or can I rename it to other names? According to [maven's suggested project structure](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html) i found online, there is a `/main/java` folder too. 
2. It seems like the `Main.java` in addressbook-level2 contains the main logic, where in my file structure, `Duck.java` contains the main logic of the application. In the case where I wish to follow addressbook's file structure, do I remove `Duck.java` and move it's code into `Main.java`?

I believe that if the commit is already pushed to the remote repo, there is no way where you can edit the commit message without changing the commit id.

Please refer to the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/changing-a-commit-message#) for your reference.

In short, you can use `git commit --amend` for rewriting latest commit
And as week 3 material, `git rebase -i` for rewriting past commits.

Just note that these commands is essentially creating a new commit to replace the old commit that you want to replace, so it is not exactly just an edit to the commit message

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Referring to oracle's documentation on [managing files](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/managingfiles.html):

> Many implementations of the Java platform rely on hierarchical file systems to manage source and class files, although The Java Language Specification does not require this. 

So I believe it is a common convention that is followed by most java platforms, that you should match example.myFile.Abc to the file path `./example/myFile/Abc.java`. The main point here is `Many implementations of the Java platform rely on hierarchical file systems to manage source and class files`, so I guess thats the purpose of needing packages' names to follow the folder path of where the file is.

I might be wrong, but one of the reason could be, when compiler sees
```
// Abc.java file
package example.myFile;
```
, it creates a corresponding Abc.class file at 
```{``outputPath``}``/example/myFile/Abc.class`

Assuming this is the default behaviour of the compiler, it seems logical to me why packages name should follow the folder path, so to match the java filepaths and the class filepaths.

I assume you are referring to the task of created a PR to the upstream repo?

In this case, by creating a PR to the upstream repo, you are essentially asking the upstream repo to review your updates and merge them into the upstream repo.

So if prof approved the PR, your code will be merged into the upstream repo.

(Isn't this exactly the case of contributing to a remote repo owned by someone else?)

delete all your tasks before exiting with 'bye' command.

Delete 3
Delete 2
Delete 1
bye
```


For input testing, theres only so much that we can do. You can explore other ways to go around this issue when you actually code test methods.

Or perhaps you can edit your batch script to check if text.txt exist and delete the text.txt file if it does before running ur programme!

Just update your input filePath accordingly!

For example, if you would like to save to
....../ip/src/main/java/test.txt,
filePath should be something like 
'src/main/java/test.txt'

I believe prof is trying to say that it is not recommended to be saving your task data inside the java folder. 

For me personally, I created a data folder specifically just to store data.
so it has the file path of
.../ip/data/test.txt

and so the input file path will be saveTasks('./data/test.txt')

Not sure if thats the best practice tho😂

Also, do check that if that folder exists before writing files to that location. Else you will have to handle that case by creating the folder

The briefing mentioned that the main reason for SLAP is to enhance readability and help maintainence of codebase easier, for you and for future developers.

I personally don't think changing the if else to conditional.of.ifblock.elseblock enhance readability. You might want to consult your teammates as well! Considering that you might write all your if else blocks in this format in your TP. 

Also, this is not abstraction right? You are still exposing the check conditions and the steps to execute in the params of the conditional

> Why is varargs unable to determine if a call is passing correct type parameters?

Because varargs are arrays, and you are trying to pass in an Array of generics. They don't go well together.

This was mentioned in cs2030s [here](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2324-s2/24-erasure.html#generics-and-arrays-cant-mix)

> But ArrayList&lt;Pair&lt;String, String>> also reduces to ArrayList during runtime, but the compiler is able to check at compile time if all method calls obey the correct parameter.

Likewise, mentioned [here](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2324-s2/25-unchecked.html)

I feel that the cs2030s notes explained it quite concisely so I won't provide a TLDR ☹  

> then is there not much advantage over just passing a new array that the compiler would inserted in compiletime, with the benefit of not dealing with unchecked exceptions?

The benefit of varargs is that it accepts a variable number of arguments, so we don't have to overload the methods. You can't have an array parameter with variable size.

There is a docs folder in your ip repository.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/684b7d4c-b78c-4e4a-bf01-8dd071d9a545)


It currently contains only a `README.md`, if you have not touched it yet.
Just:
- paste your `Ui.png` into that folder
- update the `docs/README.md`, and follow the instructions of `A-UserGuide`.

I didnt try debugging in the CLI version of Duke. The 'CLI' that I was referring to is the terminal in intellij. My bad for being vague 😪.

>@Feng1231 Hmm... that's odd. Could be an issue on the GitHub side. It's not urgent to resolve though. You can triggering CI again to see if it is a temporary issue.

We have tried
1. Creating PRs from each of our member's fork. None of it could be merged until that 'pass CI' check is done (in which it's never updated, even after ~5-10 mins of wait)
2. Pushing new commits to our forks after creating PRs, triggering a re-checking of the Java-CI and code cov checks. Even so, after the new round of check, the 'pass CI' check still won't update.

> @Feng1231 Not related specifically to this issue but you it is best to put the jar file in an empty folder, navigate to the location of the jar file file, and only then run the `java -jar` command. This is because the data files are created relative to the location in which the command is run, and data files created by other jar files can interfere with the running of the current jar file.

Will do that in the future, thank you prof for pointing that out!

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Common debugging issues when setting up javafx to individual project.**
</div>

This is a non exhaustive list of issues I faced while setting up javafx to project:

1. I forgot to add javafx.fxml to the javafx inside of build.gradle like below so they couldn't really recognise fxml files at first. The corrected version is:

```groovy
javafx ``{``
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml']
``}``
```

2. in the MainWindow.fxml file I never write the controller class path properly. The corrected version is:

```fxml
<AnchorPane maxHeight="-Infinity"
            maxWidth="-Infinity"
            minHeight="-Infinity"
            minWidth="-Infinity"
            prefHeight="600.0"
            prefWidth="400.0"
            stylesheets="@../css/main.css"
            xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17.0.7"
            xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1"
            fx:controller="mortalreminder.io.MortalReminderWindow">
```

3. Make sure to only use .png files for pictures.

4. Make sure to use the correct name/path for the image file in the MainWindow folder

5. Never change the mainClass to the appropriate one after adding the Launcher file. Corrected version:

```groovy
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("mortalreminder.io.Launcher")
``}``
```

6. After using scene builder, I didn't change the version of javafx being used to match the system. To fix I looked for:

```groovy
xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17.0.7"
```

inside the .fxml files and changed it to 17.0.7 (used to be like 22 or something)

I would like to make the runtest.bat or runtest.sh to be able to access the text-files folder as well. Right now, the code works as intended however, since during the testing the code doesnt have access to the text-files folder, it is throwing errors.

I know the code itself is fine because when i manually test it with the terminal with same inputs it works.

For number 1: I think you can refer to the website they have specified in the standards/conventions page of the website. This is the [link](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html).

For number 2, I’m not too sure but from the website they did say you can just put a few levels together so I think it should be fine if it’s not in order? However, it would be pretty weird if ur level 1 is 3 commits ahead of ur level 3, so i think as long as its not to that extent it should be fine.

I would extend this by creating a formatted printer class and have every method as a static method to standardise all the output lines like below:

Static Method 1: formattedPrinter(string)
``{``
String indent;
String separatorLine;
[add any other formatting here]
formats any message to a consistent output format and prints it using the method shared above
``}``

Static Method 2: onwards would just be things like:
markingTaskMessage(task)
``{``
string message = “enter ur message for marking a task here”;
formattedPrinter(message)
``}``

This allows u to control all ur prints from one class and standardise format without falling into cyclical dependencies later on (since this class will not make any internal references to any other classes). You can also call these methods without instantiating because all the methods will be static making the rest of the code look cleaner (as there is no random long print lines).

I have managed to fix the issue. I realised that the program I had, only supported checks to see if a file "listStorage.txt" exists or not, not the entire directory that it belongs in. Once I implemented a check to see if the "text-files" and its parent directory exists and create if it does not, both runtest.sh and runtest.bat files were able to run smoothly with no errors.

this was the block of code I added into my load function which helped to solve the issue:

```
File f = new File(storageListFilePath);

// Check if the file/folder already exists and create if it is not,
// send a warning if unable to create either and the file still does not exist
if ((!f.getParentFile().mkdirs() || !f.createNewFile()) && !f.exists()) ``{``
    FormattedPrinting.fileCorrupted();
``}``

Currently I am using Sourcetree to do the tagging and once I tag a commit, the commit tag does not move about unless I intentionally move them. New tags added also do not get added to my older commits. I would recommend using Sourcetree as mentioned in the course as I feel that it is closer to the command line (in that you can control things more specifically).

As you can see from this image the tags are stationary and do not change:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd76667f-5afa-4e31-9735-2a9b2106d053)

i suspect it has to do with the way the git GUI on intellij shows the tags on each branch (maybe all the tags found on a future commit of a particular branch will be shown for all older commits).

You can double check using sourcetree accordingly.

Personally while I do think it may be a little slower than normal, I would just do a refresh (rewrite everything on the file from scratch) every time I mark/unmark or delete things from the app. While there are concerns, like it’s slower than other methods, at this stage, I hardly think there’s going to be much lag especially cause in a reminder app such as this, the list would not run into the millions (which seems impractical), at which point only, it would take a very long time to load and unload.

Another benefit of running a refresh would be, catching any corrupted files in between, should the file be tampered with while the app is open.

Moreover, it makes the implementation a lot easier saving you a lot of development time.

Thus, I feel while this may not be the best approach for a different app, for the reasons above I think it would be a good way to implement in this type of app.

Hi I’m not sure if I’m doing it wrongly but I allowed my main class be the one just simply take inputs and throw it into the parser which then parsed the input into a command. Then I had another class, processor, which processed said inputs. My Ui class was named “formatted printer” and handled only the printing of outputs to user.

So my structure was like

Input from main -&gt; turns into a recognisable command inside of parser -&gt; the command is acted on by a processor -&gt; the resulting feedback is then printed by the UI class

Similar to the above person I used enums for my commands as well.

I wouldn’t necessarily test this method (as with any method that merely prints stuff) as it seems very trivial. I would rather test the method that may cause this method to be called on, which in this case should be something like `loadTasks()`.

In the testing for the `loadTasks()` method, I would add a test putting in a corrupted file or write some gibberish to the file first before calling `loadTasks()` on it to see if the error is handled correctly. This should let you know if it’s working as intended.

I did a few methods’ Javadocs on my own for practice and then used chatgpt to generate the rest of the docs after that. I think it should be fine but do note the Java doc generated isn’t always accurate and you should still do some corrections whenever possible.

I realised in the expected text file, they seem to trim the trailing spaces when u save the file. One way to fix this would be to format the code for ur printing method and remove any spaces before the line break

```java
public void formatPrint(String string) ``{``
    System.out.println(string + “\n”);
``}``
```

Instead of 

```java
public void formatPrint(String string) ``{``
    System.out.println(string + “ \n”);
``}``
```

@damithc hi prof, i think the scenebuilder part of tutorial 4 could have been improved because I noticed when scenebuilder modifies your .fxml file, the javafx version is changed to like 22 which causes a warning to flash every time you run the app and pass in a command.

Hi just a disclaimer, I have no official info, but going according to what I have seen in the lecture notes and examples so far, I think magic numbers should be fine as long as it’s within a very small scope say a short method. For a bigger method, I still don’t think it’s a code violation but I would still name it cause I forget what I’m doing with that number quite often 😂.

## CLI-App

I had a dedicated printing class at first when I was still working on the CLI-App. The excerpt below is of my printer class from then:

``` java
public class FormattedPrinting ``{``

    public static void formatPrint(String message) ``{``
        String indentation = "   ";
        String separatorLine = indentation + "______________________________________________________";
        StringBuilder outputMessage = new StringBuilder(separatorLine);
        String[] messageLines = message.split("\n");
        for (String line : messageLines) ``{``
            outputMessage.append("\n")
                    .append(indentation)
                    .append(line);
        ``}``
        outputMessage.append("\n")
                .append(separatorLine);
        System.out.println(outputMessage.toString());
    ``}``

    public static void welcome() ``{``
        String welcomeMessage = "Hello I'm Mortal Reminder!\n"
                + "What can I do for you?";
        formatPrint(welcomeMessage);

    ``}``
``}``
```


The first method allowed all of my print classes to have a consistent format in the printing styles. This class also mostly consisted of static methods (as seen in the second method) which could be called from other classes without instantiating an object of said class.

## GUI-App
Later on, specifically after I moved to GUI-App, I realised this method was kind of becoming redundant as the GUI basically handled all of the formatting for me. As such, I incorporated an error class which then helped to pass in any error messages. An excerpt is shown below:

``` java
/**
     * Retrieves the task at the specified index from the list.
     * <p>
     * If the index is out of bounds or the list is empty, an appropriate message is printed
     * and ``{``@code null``}`` is returned.
     *
     * @param index the index of the task to retrieve.
     * @return the ``{``@link Task``}`` at the specified index, or ``{``@code null``}`` if the index is invalid.
     * @throws MortalReminderException if the index is invalid in the list.
     */
    public Task getTask(int index) throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        try ``{``
            return this.taskList.get(index);
        ``}`` catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) ``{``
            if (this.getSize() == 0) ``{``
                throw new MortalReminderException("List is empty!");
            ``}``
            throw new MortalReminderException("Invalid task number!\n"
                    + "Please input a number between 1 and "
                    + this.getSize());
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

In spirit of laziness and not wanting to re-code everything, I changed return type in the printer class to strings. I kept the first method of the printer class as the following:

``` java
/**
     * Prints out the formatted output of the chatbot to the user.
     * An indentation is added to each line and the separator lines are added at the top and bottom of each
     * line in the message.
     *
     * @param message output message from chatbot to be printed out to the user
     * @return a version of confirmation message with specific modifications.
     */
    public static String getResponse(String message) ``{``
        return message;
    ``}``
```

and to make it "useful" maybe when I am done with this weeks tasks add a list of "personality quirks" which i can add at random to the start of each output message.

## How were these errors printed?
Basically, I had the main class in my project to do a try catch block like so:

``` java
/**
     * Initialises the execution of a command and returns the feedback message from the processor.
     *
     * @param command command created using the parser.
     * @return the string response from the chatbot after command has been executed.
     */
    public String executeCommand(Command command) ``{``
        try ``{``
            return processor.handleCommand(command, taskList);
        ``}`` catch (MortalReminderException e) ``{``
            return e.getMessage();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

I think assert is used as a safeguard in future development. If the code logic for other methods above the code are changed and the assumption is broken, you will immediately know and change the code accordingly if you had not accounted for it previously.

In terms of error vs assert, in this case the code could still work but the assumption could have become invalid.

An example could be like your delete function. It could assume the add method has already checked if the task is valid or not. However later if you add a second adding method without the check for other purposes (loading a task from file) this could be invalid in SOME cases and not all. So the code could still work but the assumption will be invalid so you would then need to account for it.

@damithc hi prof, regarding this:

> Is this needed? I don't think we mention this in the JavaFX tutorial, and we don't have it in AB3 either.

I was having issues running the app without the javafx.fxml because gradle was not recognising the .fxml files for some reason. After I added it, I was working fine.

About the new note, yeah it seems good!

I also used AI tools to do similar stuff as the above commenters, mainly Java docs and testing methods.

One other way I used AI tools, was to do some refactoring of longer methods to make the code more readable.

This was a hit or miss at times because sometimes it would just make the method more compact by combining multiple statements to one.

One way this was improved was by specifying the following:

> keep the code as readable as possible while using SLAP as much as you can to break this method into parts:
> 
> _Add method here_

There is a way to rename the branches without manually unmerging. Simply rename old assertions branch to something else first, rename the old code quality branch to assertions then the old assertions branch into code quality. You can explore it in [this](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/rename-Git-branch-local-remote-GitHub-GitLab-BitBucket) page.

Make sure to follow from 

`Git branch rename command`

Onwards.

Can you try to delete the online repository version of the branch and then push ur local repository version of the branch again? Then you can check it again later when the dashboard updates.

In the meantime maybe you can show us ur git branch graph as well so we can see if there’s any issues with the order u merged/unmerged etc.

@dominopizzaaaa

I managed to recreate ur issue on my end, i think your version here is wrong:

```id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.14'```

I tried with the above version and got a similar error.

However, when I changed to version 0.1.0 like so:

```id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.1.0'```

the error went away.

From what I see in your code, maybe its because ur Main class and your launcher class are not in the same folder. Could you put the Main Class in ur GUI package and update ur build.gradle file to include the relative path of ur launcher class from `mainClass.set("Launcher")` to `mainClass.set("GUI.Launcher")` and try again?

From what I observed in your java files, I think its certainly an interesting approach to this project. 

However, I guess it would not be sustainable as the project scales as you are effectively creating 2 classes to be able to deal with a new type of task each time which in turn makes it a hassle to create a new type each time.

If you are interested, the way I reduced complexity was to keep the creation methods into the class itself and then add a single dedicated check method for the main initialization method (creation from user) so something like:


```java
    // for creation from user input
    public Deadline(String description) throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        super(description);
        String[] descriptionString = description.split("/by");
        checkInitialisationDetails(descriptionString);
        this.description = descriptionString[0].trim();
        this.deadline = getTime(descriptionString[1].trim());
        this.type = "D"; // short for Deadline
    ``}``

    // for creation from file input
    public Deadline(String description, String deadline, boolean isDone) throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        super(description);
        this.type = "D";
        this.description = description;
        this.deadline = LocalDateTime.parse(deadline);
        this.isDone = isDone;
    ``}``

    public void checkInitialisationDetails(String[] descriptionString)
            throws MortalReminderException ``{``
        if (descriptionString.length != 2) ``{``
            throw new MortalReminderException(MortalReminderException.getInvalidDeadlineDescriptionErrorMessage());
        ``}``

        try ``{``
            getTime(descriptionString[1].trim());
        ``}`` catch (DateTimeParseException e) ``{``
            throw new MortalReminderException(MortalReminderException.getInvalidDateFormatErrorMessage());
        ``}``
    ``}``
```
The reason why there is no check for the file input is because we assume it has been saved correctly by the program as it has already gone through numerous checks beforehand.

@dominopizzaaaa from what ive seen in your `build.gradle` you seemed to have removed dependencies for all the different OS versions.

Could you try to change your dependencies in that file to something like:

```groovy
dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'

    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.7'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-fxml', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
``}``
```

Furthermore you seem to have many ShadowJar methods and excess task methods than required. Maybe you can change the application, shadowJar and run methods to match the following:

```groovy
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("mortalreminder.io.Launcher")
``}``

shadowJar ``{``
    archiveBaseName = "MortalReminder"
    archiveFileName = "MortalReminder.jar"
    archiveClassifier = null
``}``

run ``{``
    standardInput = System.in
    enableAssertions = true
``}``
```

you can also refer to my [build.gradle](https://github.com/RezwanAhmed123/ip/blob/master/build.gradle) file for more reference.

Maybe you can share more about how you are creating the jar file in the first place then?

for myself, i did it exactly like this using the Command Line:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27c8b881-fac8-424f-b567-c40ffd68db6a)

Another way to quickly see where the issue is coming from could be through the continuous integration method which is optional inside the course but I found it helpful to do a quick test to see if the app is compatible for more than my own OS. Simply follow [this](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/githubActions.html) to try and set it up. Its not too difficult, just the addition of like one folder with one file inside your directory (make sure to remove the IO redirection parts below from the file)

```groovy
      - name: Perform IO redirection test (*NIX)
        if: runner.os == 'Linux'
        working-directory:  $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        run: ./runtest.sh

      - name: Perform IO redirection test (MacOS)
        if: always() && runner.os == 'macOS'
        working-directory:  $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        run: ./runtest.sh

      - name: Perform IO redirection test (Windows)
        if: always() && runner.os == 'Windows'
        working-directory:  $``{`` github.workspace ``}``/text-ui-test
        shell: cmd
        run: runtest.bat
```

It tries to build your app in github using 3 different OS version (Ubuntu, MacOS and windows), then if there is an error you can read thru what is going on inside github like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4cbc48b-37d8-4cc4-9639-eb0b4d3123a2)

except if there is an error (not a warning like above), they will signal in red and stop the build.

I think this case is similar to issue #277 .

Your locale is probably not set up correctly leading to failures in checks.

Do also ensure that your checks properly set up and are cleaned up after each test as well (sometimes they leave fragments in your storage text files.

> Ah, I initially took a similar approach, validating both user inputs and file inputs directly within the task subclasses. However, I found that this caused the subclasses to become quite lengthy, as I was checking and parsing both file and user input within each class. In my case, I didn't have a shared parser method across all subclasses—each class had its own method for validation and parsing, which might have been the core issue. Did you encounter something similar? How did you handle it and overcome this problem?

Hi, for me I solved it by abstracting common methods as much as possible. I kept the responsibility of parsing details from both user and storage through a shared parser. The moment the input could not be parsed correctly from file an error was thrown. Type specific checks were done at the initialisation anyways which made the entire class more compact. Overall, my longest class was about 120 lines (inclusive of javadocs), which I felt was a reasonable length.

Hi, I'm not sure if this is a bug. I am on windows and I was smoke testing your app.

I opened it from the windows home view in file explorer and i could not send any commands using either "enter" key or the "send" button at the start. However, when I opened it from the downloads folder it was working fine.

I was curious about this so decided to test on my own app. I noticed if I opened it from home view in windows file explorer, I am able to send stuff but I get a "file cannot be created" feedback. So, maybe its just how errors were coded in the different apps.

Other than this issue, it was working fine.

@damithc Hi prof, actually the bug persists when i add to a clean environment (new empty folder by itself). I think its more of a file permission thing (as pointed out by @tata32000) as it will only create the necessary files when i access it thru its actual file location rather than a shortcut such as in recents of the windows explorer.

heres the new test:

Ok im not sure if this is definitely the issue but:

```java
        File directory = new File("data");
        File file = new File(filePath);

        if (!directory.exists()) ``{``
            directory.mkdir();
        ``}``

        if (!file.exists()) ``{``
            file.createNewFile();
            ui.showToUser("Created new data file optimus.txt");
            return taskList;
        ``}``
```

In your main class u already defined the filepath already and then here u are defining it differently here to check if it exists. So maybe, there is some bug which causes duplicated files (notice that the directory is defined separately before the file when in filepath it comes together) causing your storage class to be confused when it needs to create its own file. So it might be the reason why u are facing it outside of ur repo (because u need to create it there).

I would suggest changing the above code to the following:

```java
        File f = new File(filepath);
        f.getParentFile().mkdirs();
        f.createNewFile();
        f.exists();
```

hopefully it works for you!

Hi, I just followed the minimal requirement for exception handling(the two kind of error stated in level5). May I know if some other input is not considered and cause exception, will it be treated as major bugs? Thanks!

For the empty chatbox, I purposely return an empty chatbot for that situation. I am not sure if this is considered as an implementation flaw or I can leave it as it is? And for the data storage, I did not implement the stretched goal for checking corrupted database.
For the array out of bounds error message, I am pretty sure it is because of the argument length problem.(No check for argument length)

Thanks for checking!!

Hi, I have test your bot and most of the features works well!
However, I find out that the following things that may be an issue:

1. event tst /abc /from 2025-12-21 18:12 /to 2026-12-12 12:12 /dto 2027-11-04 05:14

This one ignore "/dto ....." which should not be a big issue

2. The bot never terminate after enters bye command

This one is a major issue to me as the program have no way to terminate by it self(Or this is the design of the chatbot?)

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Using Checkstyle with the agreed convention for the arrow-hand switch case notation.**
</div>

As mentioned in #49, the preferred switch case convention with the arrow-hand notation is as such:
```Java
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; 
```

However, this goes against the indentation rule where cases are supposed to be indented by `0`. 
If the `@SuppressWarnings` annotation is attempted to be used, the script still flags for this build mistake.

Instead, use the inbuilt SuppressionCommentFilter:
```Java
<module name="SuppressionCommentFilter">
            <property name="offCommentFormat" value="CHECKSTYLE.OFF\: ([\w\|]+)"/>
            <property name="onCommentFormat" value="CHECKSTYLE.ON\: ([\w\|]+)"/>
            <property name="checkFormat" value="$1"/>
        </module>
```

and add the comments above and below: for example:

```Java
// CHECKSTYLE.OFF: Indentation
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; 
// CHECKSTYLE.ON: Indentation
```

which will disable the Indentation rule for the area between the two comments.

> Note: only use this if you're sure that your code matches the convention. In this scenario, a new Checkstyle custom rule is required since it does not recognise the arrow-notation, so this is a less taxing way of building without flagging the Checkstyle.

    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;

    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; 
```

(without an assignment)
```Java
switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
case 'T' -&gt; functionT();
case 'E' -&gt; functionE();
case 'D' -&gt; functionD();
default -&gt; functionDef();

Hi. I didn't use IntelliJ to run the .sh file, and instead used the terminal! Upon checking my IntelliJ however, my interpreter options are just BASH - options: `BASH`, path: `/usr/bin/env`.

Ah. That's my bad then.

If you're using Windows, that means you most likely don't have BASH installed. There are two ways you can test now:

1. The easier way (at least, in my opinion): Using the .bat file
The .sh file requires a Unix shell - (Windows terminal is DOS) - so using a [.bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) file would be easier, as it runs natively on Windows.

2. Using the .sh file
There are a lot of ways to access BASH in Windows - one way would be to use [Git's BASH](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26522789/how-to-run-sh-on-windows-command-prompt) since that should be installed, or install another tool, or another (long-winded way, but you might find it useful for later) is to install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and move your programming environment there (which you might find helpful in the future.)

@damithc Interesting. Thanks.

In my opinion, I feel both styles should be allowed. Particularly, I personally feel the shorthand notation is extremely readable when the switch case is responsible for calculating a value for a certain variable.
 The `case` indentation should remain the same regardless.

Personally, I find that the following format is the most readable (using @michaelyql's example), where the switch case follows right after, with everything inside the code block having an extra indent (because it's technically a continuation of the statement above).
Having the case being at the exact same indentation as the actual `switch` statement will cause issues with too much characters per line if the variable being assigned has a long name for example.

```java
TaskType taskType = switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``;
```

Would like to hear input on this as well!

If `javac` is not recognised, that generally means either Java is not installed (highly unlikely since you should have used it to run this) or it's not in your PATH.

Here's [Oracle's documentation on setting JAVA_HOME](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/821-0917/inst_jdk_javahome_t/index.html). If you're not sure where your Java installation is, you can go into your Project Structure in IntelliJ, and look at Platform Settings > look at your installation and see your JDK home path there.

Agreed. I think with the way Storage is implemented as well, if this needs to be changed, it is not something that is particularly complex, as it would just change when the call to save the file is made.

It seems that you have found a workaround - but may I recommend that you check your `$JAVA_HOME` PATH variable? If your terminal is using Java19, there's a chance your current `$JAVA_HOME` points to that particular version of Java instead of the one you have to use, and it might be beneficial to change that for the rest of the module, at the very least.

According to the video, that relationship refers to the tracking of the longest `Route` by `Logic`. In that sense, it means that `Logic` might not be tracking any `Route`  when there are no routes, meaning that `Logic` is linked to 0 `Route`, and when there is at least one route, it will be associated to 1 `Route`.

Similarly on the other way round, each `Route` can only be the longest for 1 `Logic` or not the longest for any, hence the similar multiplicity.

In your dependencies, you have it misspelled: ```testImplementation group: 'org.junitm.jupiter'```.
```testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'``` is the right name.

Thus, your Gradle is unable to fetch the dependency from the repository. This should work.

In addition to what the above have said, there's also these `&hat;M` characters in your code - which I don't think SHOULD appear - they're the carriage return (for new lines).

> which would mean.. i need to finalise a working copy and push on 1 workstation before moving on the another workstation (pulling)?

Yep, hence why it is generally just better to have a local copy on both machines and push everytime you want to move to the other machine. The convenience of syncing ala-GDrive/OneDrive may be lost, but you're a lot more likely to not run into unexpected behaviour. (for example, editing on one side, then editing on the other PC and the syncing causing some conflict within the changed file).

Git also has some behaviour that isn't seen sometimes when you do push which is helpful for maintaining code across different OSes - `core.autocrlf` for example is a Git setting that helps manage line separators (that differ in Mac and Windows)

Personally, I like to think of getting the value of a `boolean` variable as a check for true or false. For example, if `isComplete` indicates if a task is complete, `checkIsComplete` indicates that the method checks if the task is complete.

With regards to this comment, I think the coding standard with regards to boolean methods refers to a "question word" prefix. While setting up the linter for my project, I turned on the `Boolean method names must start with question word` filter (under `Editor > Inspections` in IntelliJ) - clicking onto it gives a list of question words, that are generally good to go - and this has allowed me to come up with the prefixes for my boolean method/variables.

Unfortunately, it seems like there's no way to change existing files in IntelliJ (at least from my research so far - if someone has a solution).

You probably have to find some way of converting all the CRs to CRLF or LF - obviously there are manual solutions - but perhaps this might be the best.

Assuming you're on Mac, open your terminal and use `mac2unix` to convert the files.

The command is `mac2unix FILE` - try it on one file, commit and see if it works on Github, then if it does, you can do it for the rest of the files!

(if you are doing this, for consistency, set your line separator settings to /n (Linux and Unix) so that your new files follow this setting!).

I think in general, you can just utilise streams for any list processing function? Filtering, listing.

If you look at this week's task with regards to `BCDExtension` a LOT of those extensions are implemented extremely easily with a stream IMO.

Agreed with my favourite homie above @RadieonAjax, but perhaps a benefit that could be had by having it as a constant is if you can put all your constants with regards to UI messages together, you can easily change them in the future, since all of them are in one place, and it's easy to find where the message is.

I think you can just reassign the variable? Either declare it outside the switch case, or declare it in the first case with the variable and then reassign it.

Hi prof, our team is working on adding some new field and methods, the CI is passing but codecov is failing because insufficient testcase is provided. We want to ask is it necessary for us to add in the test cases for the current increment? Are we allowed to merge in our PR with the failing CodeCov or we must fix it? As the course mention we must pass the JavaCI but the CodeCov part is a bit unclear.

Hi prof, our team is a bit unsure about how much we need to complete to satisfy the requirement of adding first functionality increment. As each of us is assigned 1 or 2 MVP feature to work on, for this week is it we just need to do some part of the feature increment?

For example: We have new fields for adding new data
So the task we need to do is to
1. add the field
2. do valid check of the field format
3. store and read the field from json format
4. ....

For this week is it that we can pick to do adding the fields as part of the increment and continue to work on it on the upcoming week or we need to do more than that?

Hope my question is clear. Thank you!

**7. :fas-info-circle: Git Branch Merging**
</div>

Previously my JavaDoc branch was floating out of the master branch after commit.
And I think this may cause my branch not detected by the bot as this the only branch that is marked red in the iP progress.
<img width="519" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 9 39 36 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/706e63ff-22af-472d-b0a0-39cd5407fc08">

I spent some time solving it, and tried to turn off the fast-forwarding in Source Tree after reading this forum #131 
After some tries, now there is no more floating branches, but there is quite a lot of parallel branch created.
<img width="816" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-05 at 10 10 09 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a541e06b-5d2a-42c0-9a3a-79a7fa3f7e67">

May I ask
1. Is the fast forwarding the reason causing the JavaDoc branch to be floating without merging back? Or is it cause by other problem (Not merging branch correctly, etc)
2. How to correctly merge branch to avoid creating a lot of parallel branch like the second screenshot?

Hope my question is clear :D

In the website they mentioned like this
"Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you think you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it. We don't check the code to see if you have actually done the said increment. Therefore, it is just a mechanism for you to self-declare progress and for us to monitor those progress declarations."

So I think it doesn't not affect much if your initial tag is at the commit that meet the requirement stated in the website for the particular level. I think there is no harm by moving the tag to your latest update, but it could better to remove the previous one so you won't end up with several tag if you have multiple updates/revisions. Or maybe could go with Level-1.1, Level-1.2 tags. This just from my understanding of the usage of tags from the 2103 website and other resources, hopefully my opinion is helpful :)

For me I don't actually has method that print out different command error, I had a parent class for Exception (`ToothlessException`) and some inherited class that represent different type of error such as `MissingIndexException`, `MissingDescriptionException` and etc. Each has used the `super(String errorMessage)` in their own constructor to pass the error message to be printed. And I used `try` `catch` in my `main()` method to print the message from the exception via `e.getMessage()`. Not sure is this the best way to do it but it reduce the need to create lots of methods in the `Ui` class to print the messages. Hope it will helps!

Hi I just downloaded your chatbot. I am using Mac aIso and I briefly tested the program and it runs well!
Good to see you have design your own GUI, you also added different color to the dialog box when command like `delete`, `mark`, `unmark` is entered. A red dialog box is also shown when there is error in the command entered bu the user, well done! Seen you also implemented a `help` command that guide the user how to use the chatbot in the app, this is a good guide for new users! Overall I haven't test out an error on the chatbot.

# Use of AI Tools in the Project
(This is from my iP AI.md file)
## Introduction

Several AI tools are used in the development of the project (Toothless Chatbot). The AI tools employed in this project are ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot. These AI tools have enhanced the coding workflow, improved productivity, and raised quality standards in the project.

## AI Tools Used

### 1. ChatGPT and Claude

These two AI tools are primarily used to enhance written communication, code explanation, and problem-solving for the project.

#### Applications

- **Improving Documentation**: These AI tools are mainly used as writing assistants to refine user guides, README files, and PR descriptions.
- **Enhancing Code-Related Communication**: They are also used to improve grammar and clarity in PR descriptions and aid in generating informative and standardized commit messages.
- **Problem Solving and Ideation**: The tools are used to aid in brainstorming feature ideas and implementation strategies. Sometimes they are used to suggest alternative approaches to enhance feature functionalities.

#### Things to Note When Using ChatGPT and Claude
- **Review and Refinement**: Always review and refine the generated content to ensure accuracy and relevance to the project. As sometime the review given might be irrelevant to the project or out of the context of the project.
- **Use in Specific Contexts**: Use these tools in specific contexts where they can provide the most value, such as documentation, communication, and ideation. Try to give the prompt in such a way that the AI can understand the context of the project, so they can give more accurate suggestions.
- **Avoid Over-Reliance**: Avoid over-reliance on AI-generated content and ensure that the final output aligns with the project's goals and requirements. As the AI can give suggestions but the developer should been the one to give ideation and make the final decisions.

### 2. GitHub Copilot

Copilot is mainly used as a real-time coding assistant to enhance the productivity of the project.

#### Applications

- **Code Generation**: It is used to suggest complete functions based on comments or function names. It suggests boilerplate code for common patterns. It also aids in autocompleting repetitive structures such as loop constructs and error handling.
- **API and Library Usage**: It also suggests library functions and methods to be used to create project features. It can also aid in autocompleting import statements for required modules.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Copilot also aids in error handling by providing quick fixes for common errors like syntax errors. It can also be used to aid in debugging by suggesting possible causes of bugs or errors.
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: It provides relevant code snippets based on the surrounding code context and suggests variable names that align with existing naming patterns.
- **Documentation**: It also aids in completing documentation such as writing header comments for classes and functions.

#### Things to Note When Using GitHub Copilot
- **Code Review and Refinement**: Always review and refine the code generated by Copilot to ensure correctness and alignment with project standards as sometime Copilot can give suggestions that are not relevant to the project.
- **Use in Specific Contexts**: Utilize Copilot in specific contexts where it can provide the most value, such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. These can let Copilot to give more detailed and accurate suggestions.
- **Avoid Over Reliance**: Avoid over-reliance on Copilot-generated code to avoid substituting fundamental coding skills with AI assistance. Always ensure that the code align with the project requirement and understand how the code works. 

## Benefits of AI Integration in the Project

1. **Efficiency**: Using these tools significantly reduces time spent on routine coding tasks, documentation, and problem-solving.
2. **Learning and Skill Development**: Accelerates learning of new concepts and coding skills when the tools are used appropriately.
3. **Communication**: Enhances the clarity and effectiveness of code-related communications.
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Handles low-level details and allows developers to focus on higher-level problem-solving.

## Things to Note When Using AI Tools in Development of the Project

1. **Critical Review**: Always review and understand AI-generated content before incorporation, as it may not always be correct or suitable for use. Reviewing and understanding the content also helps avoid over-reliance on AI for coding, which may hinder developers from gaining knowledge through the project.
2. **Use it as Augmentation, Not Replacement**: Use AI to enhance the project development but not as a substitute for fundamental coding skills.
3. **Balance of using AI and Human Skills**: Ensure to maintain a balance between AI assistance and human creativity to preserve the project's unique aspects and learning purpose in building the project.

## Conclusion

The integration of ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot has significantly enhanced my iP development process, especially in improving code quality, documentation, and overall productivity.

I think the problem that the `## Guide` is having an extra whitespace before the `##` as shown below (highlighted part). By removing it should render the markdown correctly.

### Some Suggestions
Besides here are some suggestion for the GFMD for your UG

1. Format can be shown in inline code
<img width="380" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 2 11 10 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6540ab76-b46c-479d-a07e-af19c5884cf9">

- With inline code

----

2. Consider using `$_num$` for the subscript

---

3. Consider setting first characters of word in headings as capital letters
<img width="383" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 2 15 30 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73712728-fceb-4455-b810-ca3406790591">

---

4. Bold the first line or important keywords of the paragraph instead of the whole paragraph
<img width="413" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-21 at 2 15 53 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a086c579-c4ba-4df1-bbfc-00b8eb89e475">

Thank you prof for clarifying, the naming for the new release can be anything? like `v0.3` or should i replace the `v0.2` release and retag it?

Im not sure whats the reason behind it too, in the tutorial, we used the default font and font size i believe. When u play around with different font, it seems to overrun the text into ellipsis.

Hi thanks, i manage to somehow get the .jar file to work by adding this line of code:
'''
file.getParentFile().mkdirs();
''''

The problem for my .jar file previously was that it could not find the .txt file.
So, I created a .txt file in the directory of the jar file with the code above.

However, I am still not sure why is it that windows have this issue whereas from others, MACOS and Unix seem to work fine..? (i.e. windows cannot find the file path but macos and UNIX can find)

Using windows machine here too:

The bot did not respond when i typed in an invalid date. But at least it didn't crash, that's great.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c73dc0a2-0ac5-49e5-a2af-4e14d0acb775)

Just maybe can handle if the date is before the current date, don't allow it maybe 🤔
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa9b4b0d-c205-42cd-9b58-04a2d555f39a)

or if the end date is &lt; than the start date:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/096d040a-5f20-4c19-981e-b31ea104d94c)

But overall no crashes! Well done!

**1. :fas-info-circle: Failed test cases from the iP repo for iP evaluation**
</div>

Hi prof, I am currently going through the code of iP project that I was assigned through the email, but I have stuck at the part of checking **test & exceptions** because the situation is bit complicated and I would need advice on how to evaluate the work...

Basically, the test case files are not inside a package called test and instead they are under the respective package of the files that they test against(like TaskListTest.java is together with TaskList.java in the same package). As a result, when gradle runs, the tests are not triggered because gradle couldn't find the source to run the test. (As you can see, the test task is not run at all and gradle indicate the reason as no source)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/908ea321-c3db-4ff1-b3a2-10b5966618c4)

I am not sure if the above issue is a big deal, but when I try to clone this repo and run the test cases locally, I realized there are actually test cases that failed. 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b23483d-88ea-4233-842c-1cb7d7e7f392)

I feel like if everything is like this then the test cases are not properly written and no longer serves the purpose. I have tested the product and it works fine but I think the test is implemented very poorly. In this case how should I grade this project? Should I give 0 because the test cases do not serve the desired purposed, or should I give 1 since there are at least 1 or 2 methods tested for each class? Thank you prof for your time!

Hi prof, when doing this week's tP task I realized that apart from instruction of including acknowledgement of AB-3 in README, there's another section in developer guide called acknowledgement also but there seems to be no instruction on updating this part, may I check if we should acknowledge AB-3 in our developer guide as well? Thank you!

</div>

Hi prof, I was taking a brief look at week 8's tP task(just to get rough idea of what to expect for future weeks, not attempting to do it now), I realized that there are some typos in the task description:
1. Under `Admin  tP: Practical Exam (PE) → Guidelines for bug triaging (extract 1)`
    1. In `Functionality bugs`, there is one part that says `be not than 8 digits`, which should be `be not more than 8 digits`.
    2. In `Feature flaws`, there is one part that says `instead, it shows the even in a ligher color`, which should be `instead, it shows the event in a lighter color`

**5. :fas-info-circle: Implemented stream before this weeks increment, can I simply tag that commit as A-Stream? Also, seeking more advices on use of streams**
</div>

Hello prof, I would like clarify if it is ok to tag a previous week's commit with current week's increment tag? Because I realize that my project actually has already implemented some methods with the help of Java stream which means my project technically fulfills the requirement specified by A-Stream, and I am not really sure where else I can actually implement stream within my program. Thank you.

Also, for others who are currently working on this week's tasks, what are your use of streams in your own program? For me, I have designed my delete task method to accept multiple task numbers as variable arguments, and since ArrayList will left shift all the objects after the deleted object after deletion, I have used stream to map the task numbers to corresponding tasks in the ArrayList and delete them by object reference instead of index(because left shifting of object will mess up the index of the rest of object, introducing error to the feature) to ensure the correct objects are deleted. Would appreciate if anyone can offer some hints on other possible usage of stream, so I can try make some new improvements instead of just tagging previous commit for this week task, thank you!

**7. :fas-info-circle: 💡Duke Level-1: Allow case-insensitive comparison for user inputs using equalsIgnoreCase()**
</div>

Hello guys, just sharing a tip over here in case if you are wondering how you can make your chatbot more flexible when handling user inputs as an enhancement for user experience. I know this is not compulsory requirement for the project, but it may be helpful if you are wondering about how to do it in Java.

In Java we know that we can use `equals()` method to compare the values of two String objects instead of their references, however, we can use `equalsIgnoreCase()` method if you not only want to compare the String Objects just by values but also want the comparison to be case-insensitive. This method can be useful if you want the chatbot to response to a certain command regardless of how exactly it is spelled.

For example, if you want the chatbot to say goodbye to the user and exit regardless of whether the user inputs "Bye", "BYE", "bye" or any other form. Instead of writing 
```
if (userInput.equals("bye")) ``{``
    // Your exit logic
``}``
```
you can write something like this
```
if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase("bye")) ``{``
    // Your exit logic
``}``
```
Hope that helps if you are seeking some improvements for your project, thank you.

@somethingfishyfishy My reasonings when answering this question are like these:

1. Even though score of the team is discrete and finite, we may want to perform arithmetic operations on it, such as adding a score when the team wins a game or subtracting the score when the team receives a penalty, which is not supported by the enum type, (and just to add on, enum types are usually used for comparison, switch statements and other non-arithmetic operations) hence representing the team score using enum type variable is not appropriate.

2. Just like what @ITLimJiaWei has mentioned above but I would like to just add on. One of the key reason why we use enum types in our program is to ensure that our users don't enter garbage values into the system which can potentially cause a lot of errors and issues, and it is one of the way that strongly typed languages like java used to limit user input to a finite set of possible options while still ensuring type safety in the system. However, in this case you are just working with very large range of int values where you just need to check about the values and not the types. Therefore, instead of exhaustively declare each int value as a enum type value which greatly compromise the readability and performance of the program, it is better to just use conditional statement to check whether the team's score is within the acceptable range.

Hope that helps.

I agree with @cth06-Github 's opinion that using enum for recognizing command type introduces redundant logics within the program. I am also a bit confused about the possible use of enums within the current scope of the project, but if more customization is allowed at this stage of project development, I believe we can use enum to specify status of the task(just like all these other task management outside, we can have more status than just done & not done, such as cancelled) and the priority of the task(low, medium, high etc.), because they both represents finite and discrete sets of values which we want the user to choose from.

I think at this point of time you can leave it as it is, but putting it inside a `handleExit()` method may help in the future if your program actually needs to invoke multiple clean up methods before the program actually exit, in that case having a method to handle exit logics and stuff all the clean up methods inside can make the code a lot cleaner. Hope this idea helps

I realize that when the message box is too big, the pointing edge of the dialog bubble would not correctly point to the avatar as the avatar itself would always stay the top of the control.
But there's an easy workaround with this issue, all you need to do is just wrap the ImageView that represent the avatar in a VBox and set the alignment to `BOTTOME_CENTER` like below:
```
<VBox alignment="BOTTOM_CENTER">
            <ImageView fx:id="displayPicture" fitHeight="99.0" fitWidth="99.0" pickOnBounds="true" preserveRatio="true"/
</VBox>
```
and then you can easily get the result like the above image.

Hi, I have tried played around with the `checkstyle.xml` file and this approach may help with your issue.
1. First locate the following block of code in your `checkstyle.xml`
```
&gt;!--
    IMPORT CHECKS
    -->

    &gt;!-- Checks the ordering of import statements follow the rules that the default Eclipse formatter uses.
    The order rule "STATIC###STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE###SPECIAL_IMPORTS###THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE" consists of:
      1. STATIC: static imports
      2. STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE: standard java/javax imports
      3. SPECIAL_IMPORTS: defined as org imports
      4. THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE: defined as com imports
    -->
    <module name="CustomImportOrder">
        <property name="customImportOrderRules"
            value="STATIC###STANDARD_JAVA_PACKAGE###SPECIAL_IMPORTS###THIRD_PARTY_PACKAGE"/>
        <property name="specialImportsRegExp" value="&hat;org\."/>
        <property name="thirdPartyPackageRegExp" value="&hat;com\."/>
        <property name="sortImportsInGroupAlphabetically" value="true"/>
    </module>
```
2. Change `<property name="specialImportsRegExp" value="&hat;org\."/>` to `<property name="specialImportsRegExp" value="&hat;javafx\."/>`
3. Change `<property name="thirdPartyPackageRegExp" value="&hat;com\."/>` to `<property name="thirdPartyPackageRegExp" value="&hat;zbot\."/>`

Now you should see the warning fading away when you use your own way to import packages. I have tried this approach in my own code and it works pretty well:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70723399-7124-44d8-9719-91a3bec539fa" width="50%" />

However, just to say that I don't fully understand the initial values used by these two properties so there may be some repercussions when you change the file in the above way. But the general idea should be group the imports in separate groups and specify their order in the `CustomImportOrder` property, then `checkstyle.xml` should automatically reinforce line separations between the desired groups.

Sorry if I misinterpret this, but I believe that the notes and the webinar is talking about different things. You can refer to the diagram included in the textbook as part of my reasoning:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c1a844-6326-4da7-a9f0-94fb5121c42f)

Note mentions **UML class diagram** which is only about the class diagram and it is true that it shows shows the structure and not the behavior because the diagram only shows the associations between the classes and nothing else.

Webinar, on the other hand, mentions **UML diagram** which can consists of may different kinds of diagram and some of them such as state machine diagram and user case diagram can be used to model behaviors of the program.

Hence, in my opinion, there's no discrepancy between the above contents. Hope that helps with the issue, some please correct me if I am wrong thank you

Works well on my machine! Good job!

**Some issues that you may want to take it seriously**:
1. Program is not responding me with any error message when I input `delete -1`, while it shows error message when I input `mark -1` and `unmark -1`
2. It seems like your `mark` and `delete` commands are giving out similar but differently phrased error message, I am not sure why is that the case and maybe this is the cause of issue 1? Just be sure that you handle this kind of error through a single method so that everything can behave as expected in a consistent manner.
3. When I mess up the task file and enter the application again, tasks with invalid save data becomes null on the list(and in some other cases jar file can't be opened any more due to `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`). As a result, I can't even close the application either because the code that handles saving feature can't handle null objects properly. Not sure if this is serious or not...But I believe it is better to address situations when the file is corrupted when user opens the application, just like how we did for the CLI version.

Just to add on, your user guide is super amazing and impressive, I can see that you are really putting in a lot of effort to craft  it! Good job!

It works well, good job! No serious issues found, but maybe somethings to take note:
1. For the submission of Ui.png, I remember one of the requirements is to show the product name in the screenshot and preferably at the title of the application window, so you may want to fix on that.
2. The cmd window keeps on showing messages as I inputting commands, especially when I open the application, it feels a bit weird that the welcome message shows in the cmd instead of on the application window.
3. As according to the requirement and prof's reply to other people's clarification(see #309), it would be better if you can include logic that will warn user about corrupted save file when they open the application. Currently if I mess up the local save file, the tasks are simply not created on the application which I believe is not major bugs, but it is still better if you can fix it.

Hi I am using Windows 11, it works well on my machine.
I think there may be something that you may want to look into and fix?:
1. I think this is a trivial one because normal user wouldn't do something like this, but it seems like you are storing time as string for your task? and as a result I can input something like 25pm or 100pm without the program complaining about anything...Also, I believe it is possible for a user to accidentally typed some other things when inputting time and causes unexpected behaviour of your program. Even though user can delete and add in the correct one(provided he/she realized about the typo), it may fail the iP requirement of handling error gracefully, but whether to fix it is up to you. Personally I as a user think this is acceptable, but you may not want to handle things in this way again during the tP.
2. The user guide says that the command `remind` will remind user of the upcoming deadlines and events but the program only shows me events that happened on that day and not the deadlines, so you may want to either fix your program if this is not the intended behaviour or fix the user guide if it shows the wrong instruction
3. Currently the program does not show any error message if the file is corrupted

I think the association line between History and ActionX/Y are not necessary because this can be inferred from the class diagram itself. Since History object tracks references of Repeatable Interface Object(which is implemented by Action abstract class and eventually inherited by ActionX/Y classes), this implies that History would have references to ActionX and ActionY objects(as history, as indicated by the association role between History and Repeatable objects).

For the email body part, I think composition only implies that child's existence must depend on parent's existence and not the other way around. In some cases, you may initialize a parent object with some of its parts being undefined and only assign them afterwards, then this would actually imply a multiplicity of 0 for the child object. One possible case I can think of maybe is like other than Email class, I want to create a Draft Class that contains the information that I want to send but haven't finished yet, then in case when I try to save an email as a draft, I may create a Draft object in which the body is null. Hence, even though in this case body is part of the Draft, I can still have its multiplicity as 0, and the fact that Draft has-a body only implies that when I delete this draft, its body also gets deleted as well and not the other way around.


Hope these helps.

Hi, sorry if I misunderstand the question or just mentioning the obvious parts which you may have already take into considerations, but from prof's explanation in the video(at 06:47), the read() methods are repeated in the child classes because they are implemented differently from the parent class(overriding parent implementation instead of just inheriting from the parent class). On the other hand, if the read() method is just inherited then we should not include them. 

You can also refer to diagrams that are included in the course material under the inheritance UML class diagram section to check this out. For example,
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32a60119-b1bc-4b22-9d4c-00bf9b4f2bb9)

In this case, the Car class does not need to include the fields and methods inherited from Vehicle, assuming that Car does not override them.

2) Extend MainWindow to have a Stage as a root Node.

Hi, this is from W4.3 of course topics. 

I don't understand what the diagram labels "head in" and "tail in" mean. They don't have arrows to show which direction they are referring to. Since they are closer to Snake, I would assume that it means SnakeHeadSquare's head is in Snake. 

I am not sure why the question uses the phrase "Snake head" when there is only "Snake" and "SnakeHeadSquare".

**2. :fas-info-circle: 💡Handling time locality uniformly across all machines**
</div>

Hi all, 

I realised that date-time parsing may throw a lot of unexpected errors, across different machines. I tested my code using Gradle, and also using Windows subsystems for linux (WSL), and was surprised to find bugs. This was similar to the issue I found in #277, where the github servers do not have the same time locale as my PC. 

To handle this, I realised I could set the time locale in my Main class, ensuring that all users who use the Jar file will have the same uniform experience as well. Here is one way to solve it: 

In the ```Main``` class:
```java
public void start(Stage stage) ``{``
        try ``{``
            // Set default locale to Singapore
            Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "SG"));
            // Set default time zone to Singapore
            TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Asia/Singapore"));
            // irrelevant code omitted
    ``}``

```

Hope this helps!

**4. :fas-info-circle: 💡Setting Time Locale for CI build to ensure consistency between local build and on Github servers**
</div>

Hi everyone, I was trying to figure out why I was failing the CI builds but passing the build and check tests locally. 

It turns out that running JUnit tests to parse dates and times locally had a different Time Locale as compared to the github servers, causing errors. 

Thought that it would be helpful to share my findings on how to resolve this! 

**Solution: Set Time locale in the test class to ensure consistency**
To ensure consistency both locally and on Github, I realised I could use the @BeforeAll annotation for Junit tests, to set a fixed time locale. 
```java
//import required for the BeforeAll annotation
import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;

//Inside the test class
//    @BeforeAll
    public static void setUp() ``{``
        Locale.setDefault(new Locale("en", "SG"));
        TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Asia/Singapore"));
    ``}``

```

Hope this helps! 👍

I believe this may have occured because of 2 possible scenarios: 

1. Intellij may have been configured to use fully qualified class names. 
To remove this, ensure that your configuration has unchecked "Use fully qualified class names"
-> Settings -&gt; codestyle -&gt; java -&gt; imports
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3a63b39-fedd-415e-9933-ec5527a999c9)
Make sure that it is unchecked. 

2. There may have been multiple imports that has the List interface
In this scenario, Intellij may find it ambiguous on which type you are declaring, hence prompting the use of fully qualified names. If this is the case, troubleshoot to see if there are multiple imports that have this interface, and removing/deconflicting if unnecessary. 


Personally, as per what @adipanda2002 said, it may also be wise to just use  `ArrayList` instead. I did this, and hence did not encounter this error

Hope this helps :)

I did something very similar to @JagdeepSinghNUS but i noticed that just typing Platform.exit() would immediate close the window, without allowing the user to read my goodbye message. 

To handle this, I added a time-delay to allow the user to read the final message (i.e: confirming that his log has been saved successfully, and the program would exit in 3 seconds) 

I did put this under the "handle input" method in MainWindow.java

Here is how I did it: 
```java
    @FXML
    private void handleUserInput() ``{``
       //earlier irrelevant part of method body not shown
        if (response.equalsIgnoreCase(monique.getUi().showGoodbye())) ``{``
            PauseTransition pause = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(3));
            pause.setOnFinished(event -&gt; stage.close());
            pause.play();
        ``}``
    ``}``
```

I agree with @yadobler, I think it's best if you abstract out the variable `int id` before each `case`. 

However, if not all of the cases have an `int id`, then perhaps you current implementation where you add a closure may be better.

### Applications of AI
- Use of ChatGPT to write JUnit tests
- Use of ChatGPT to aid in writing JavaDoc comments

### General experience
- ChatGPT tends to hallucinate quite a fair bit when it comes to implementing logic. I found that it is much better to handle the logic myself, then use chatGPT to do things that do not require much logic but rather laborious and repetitive. 
- For Javadoc comments, it is wise to send over the required coding style, so that the output is consistent with the course requirements

I used streams for certain commands like the `MarkCommand`,`UnmarkCommand` and `FindCommand`. As other users have mentioned, I think streams can be used wherever there are Lists involved. In my opinion, they make the code a bit more readable. Also, I searched my repo to find code where there were for-loops used. For those, I converted it to streams to increase safety. Curious also to see how others have used this!

I think this is occuring because you already have the tag (A-MoreOOP) on your remote repository, as shown here https://github.com/Elinengu/ip/tags

I had this same problem in week 1, so what I did was delete the tag in the remote repo, and then re-push from my local repo to the remote repo. However, when I did this, it was within the same week/ same day so I don't think it would affect the scripts that were running. 

Not too sure if this will affect the IP dashboard tracking. Prof @damithc, please advise if this will cause the submission in previous weeks to be 'late' 

One alternate solution could be to:
- delete the tag on your local repo
- Merge local and remote 
- shift tag up to appropriate position in SourceTree.

I think for one of the commits (491f192), the git commit message does not start with a verb in the imperative tense.

Perhaps, you can start with "Add assertion ...".

I believe the error message is just showing that your code violates checkstyle, which you've used when building with gradle.

There are 2 general solutions you can adopt:
1. Edit the code at all the relevant locations to satisfy checkstyle. 
Before you push to the remote repo, you can just run the build check locally, to see if the checkstyle tests pass. 
`gradlew check`

2. Disable checkstyle in your gradle build as suggested in #265

I think the reason why there is no association line drawn between History and ActionX/Y lines is because Action X/Y are stored as Repeatable objects.  History class thus only depends directly on the Repeatable class, given the method signature of add(Repeatable). This makes the UML diagram less cluttered, and more generalised, as any Repeatable object can be added to the History object. 

Regarding the email and body, since a "body" cannot exist without an email, the composition makes sense. However, the multiplicity of 0..1 indicates that an email can have no body. (e.g: imagine sending an email with just the title and no body, it would still work). Composition still makes sense, its just that the parts (i.e: body) cannot exist without the whole (email).

## Use of AI Tools in the Project

* **GitHub Copilot** to auto-generate code snippets in some methods to save time.
* **ChatGPT** to generate the task description for the task, `Parser` class, and unit tests.

## What Works Well

**GitHub Copilot** is a great tool for generating code snippets for methods that are not implemented yet. It saves time and helps to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input string was generated by GitHub Copilot.

**ChatGPT** is a great tool for generating the task description for the task and `Parser` class. It saves time and helps to understand the code better. For example, the parser method to extract the task description from the input string was generated by ChatGPT. The tool is also very helpful for generating unit tests for the project. Javadoc is also generated using ChatGPT.

Hi @vinceg4, I have tested on MacOS and it seems to be working very well. I have a suggestion to show the task name as it's being added (e.g. I've added read book to the task list).

@EdaYeo I have tested your app in MacOS and it shows this error when first launch:

It would be nice if we can unmark the task if the user marks the task as done by accident. Overall, the app looks pretty nice and everything works as intended.

hi guys
i was trying to undo a commit as i had named it wrongly using this instruction:
"To undo the last commit, right-click on the commit just before it, and choose Reset current branch to this commit.

In the next dialog, choose the mode Mixed - keep working copy but reset index option. This will make the offending commit disappear but will keep the changes that you included in that commit intact."

however i then pushed and now my work done on intellij is also back to the previous commit, without all my recent work.
 is there any way to get it back :(

thanks in advance

The website says "Only merged branches are detected by the script" if I do not do "Compare and pull request" then merge the branches in the pull request, will the script detect that I merge the branches using Git CLI on my local computer?

So the steps are
1. push your branch to github branch
2. merge branch to master on your computer
3. push the merge commit on master to github master
4. Leave the branch alone, don't delete it

Is this the correct process ?

So I realised I needed to do --no-ff so that the merge commits will be reflected in github.
Right now this is my SourceTree graph

Is this correct ? I had to force push to github because I needed to redo the commits for Level-7 too, I forgot to add --no-ff when merging branch-Level-7

Okay Prof I messed up my branching big time, I forgot I was in branch-Level-7 when creating branch-Level-8 as I use Git from the CLI, so I am not actively shown which branch I am in, and now changing the commit history to ensure it fits the correct branching is too difficult for me already. 

Will I be penalised, and can I keep my current code, if not I have to reset to Level-6 and restart branch-Level-7 and branch-Level-8 again? 

Will the scripts detect the branches and merges correctly, i.e "Only merged branches are detected by the script" will this statement be satisfied

Is this what you mean when you say "merging of the branches is reflected in the repo"? Otherwise, how should we know if the merging is reflected in the repo, and the scripts will be able to detect the merge branches

You got be to be kidding me Prof, I thought when the website said not to delete the branches, I thought it meant not to delete the branches on github. I think the website can be more clear on what to do. Can I clarify what is the expected process for Level-7 and Level-8?

hi! the description for a [critical path](https://arc.net/l/quote/nbyhzenm) states that 'In the example above, the shortest possible path is also the critical path.', but I don't see how the middle path is considered the shortest path if the path below it(persistency support design paths) is shorter. are all critical paths the shortest paths? or just paths which can't be delayed? thank you!

I think you can try checking if you have multiple data files in your directory that might store two different task lists. As in the image below, the correct data file should be under the `ip/data` folder and not `ip/src/main/java/cleo/data`. I'm not sure how i got he second data folder before but this could be a possibility!

Well it doesn't work because somehow, the app doesn't recognise the interpreter

By the way, this is more detail of how to do it with SourceTree:
1. Create (if you haven't had one) Personal Access Token that allows `workflow` in github.
2. Navigate to Repository -&gt; Repository Settings and change the URL of `origin` from 
`https://github.com/&lt;your_git_hubname>/ip.git`
to `https://&lt;The_Personal_Access_Token_key>@github.com/&lt;your_github_name>/ip.git`
You can see The_Personal_Access_Token_key after create the token.

**1. :fas-info-circle: TP Tutorial 1 Week 6 help**
</div>

Hi guys, Mac user here, I keep on getting this error when following the steps for the team project tutorial 1 of week 6. So when pressing the debug button on the top right of the Main file, MainApp file etc, I get the error: 

```
Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Error initializing QuantumRenderer: no suitable pipeline found
```

or 

```
JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
```

Im not sure how to settle this issue and I cant seem to debug the code either way

Also, the second problem I am having is that the src/test/java/seedu.address/commons/util/AppUtilTest keeps on getting an error when I run the ```gradle build``` command. This is the specific line of code I get the error from

```
public class AppUtilTest ``{``
    @Test
    public void getImage_exitingImage() ``{``
        assertNotNull(AppUtil.getImage("/images/address_book_32.png"));
    ``}``
```

and this is the error given to me

```

**3. :fas-info-circle: Issue with making the jar file run the code**
</div>

Hi I'm also getting this issue. I'm using a Macbook and it seems that this problem only occurs when trying to run from the jar file. If I do the ```./gradlew run``` on the IntelliJ terminal, it works fine and I can read the previous safe file. But if I do ```./gradlew clean shadowJar``` and go to the directory and run the following, I get the error message:

My input in the terminal
``` 
java -jar Winde.jar
```

The error message I get

```
Error in creating fileNo such file or directory
Error Loading Tasks to File: ../src/main/java/windebot/WindeTasks.txt (No such file or directory)
```

So I tried changing the file path to ```WindeTasks.txt```  instead of the ```../src/main/java/windebot/WindeTasks.txt``` and I get a long error message:

```

This is the line 60 code in History:

**5. :fas-info-circle: Error message when loading AddressBook.jar**
</div>

When I follow the steps on the CS2103 website on opening AddressBook, I get an error at step 4

Here is the instructions from the CS2103 website:

Quick start
1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest .jar file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your AddressBook.

4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the java -jar addressbook.jar command to run the application.
A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.


Here is the error code from terminal:

Hi I'm also getting this issue. I'm using a Macbook and it seems that this problem only occurs when trying to run from the jar file. If I do the ```./gradlew run``` on the IntelliJ terminal, it works fine and I can read the previous safe file. But if I do ```./gradlew clean shadowJar``` and go to the directory and run the following, I get the error message:

My input in the terminal

```
Error in creating fileNo such file or directory
Error Loading Tasks to File: ../src/main/java/windebot/WindeTasks.txt (No such file or directory)

So I tried changing the file path to ```WindeTasks.txt```  instead of the ```../src/main/java/windebot/WindeTasks.txt``` and I get a long error message:

```

was referring to my save method, not my load method as mentioned above. Because I forgot to change the file directory of my save method. Now it works! Thank you!

```

Thank you all for your help once again but after thinking a bit, it may be due to the runtest.sh being a feature for the previous weeks without the GUI requirement. Hence my main class now is the Launcher class instead of the Winde class. Maybe this is the issue? Or maybe when I changed my GitHub personal token and had to sign into my GitHub account on IntelliJ again it detected that I had this error whenever I push new commits. 


Anyways this issue doesn't really affect my end product of my iP (jar file) and so I think I will just close this issue. It is just annoying that everytime I push a commit I get this email saying my JAVA CI workflow has an issue.

Thanks so much prof!

Also gonna leave this here for anyone else also having trouble for the Second part of the tp tutorial of Week 6

I still got some error when doing the ```./gradlew check``` so this is what I did to rectify this issue:

Change the toStringMethod() of test/java/seedu/address/model/person/PersonTest.java to be the following. It should be on line 93.

```
    @Test
    public void toStringMethod() ``{``
        String expected = Person.class.getCanonicalName() + "``{``name=" + ALICE.getName() + ", phone=" + ALICE.getPhone()
                + ", email=" + ALICE.getEmail() + ", address=" + ALICE.getAddress() + ", remark=" + ALICE.getRemark()
                + ", tags=" + ALICE.getTags() + "``}``";
        assertEquals(expected, ALICE.toString());
    ``}``
```

Second thing is to comment out the entire last method of test/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPersonTest.java. The method is toModelType_invalidTags_throwsIllegalValueException()

Only then do I get no errors for doing ```./gradlew check```

Maybe there's a better way to do it @damithc ?

Why does the FC command in the bat file highlight my text art as differing in the expected and actual file? I copied it from my output and put in the expected text. 

it would appear there are some missing spaces in some lines of the expected.txt which are in the Actual.txt but if I copy them over to the expected text they disappear after I run the runtest.bat.

Immutability is for safe sharing of object internals between classes (keeps them safe from any changes), idt there's any need for that at this stage of the project however as the mostly likely implementation of duke is using switch statements.

Task can only navigate to the Repeatable class not the Action class as seen from the method signature of in the Class diagram being Task(Repeatable Task), what the actual type of the Task is isn't reflected since it is taken in as a Repeatable. This is different from an object diagram where we just directly show what object is being put inside since clarifying it is identified as a Repeatable in the :Task would be extremely messy and confusing as it might be interpreted as a new object rather than the same one but identified as a different a Type

Composition allows 0 since it's only a one-way thing. The parent Class may or may not have it's children-Class(es) but the child classes Cannot exist without the parent class

Can I clarify on _the users_ here? Does it really mean any users, or users within the organization only? If it is any users from the general public, how can we ensure the product is used under controlled conditions?

This is a actually good point I did not consider.

Searching online, there is a highly upvoted stackoverflow question that discusses this problem, here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34571/how-do-i-test-a-class-that-has-private-methods-fields-or-inner-classes

I found one comment by Colin M which I found convincing, that says
> By testing private methods you are testing the implementation. This defeats the purpose of unit testing, which is to test the inputs/outputs of a class' contract.

So I guess in your specific situation, instead of trying to test directly on private fields of TaskList, you may test through its exposed interfaces (there should be some public method like getTask()). 

That said, it is just my immature idea. If anyone has a different opinion or approach, please feel free to comment below!

Just to add on:
When performing an auto reformat, IntelliJ by default collapses import from the same package as one single wildcard import when the number reaches 5 (which violates CS2103T coding standard). For example,
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.TreeMap;
```
will be auto-reformatted to 
```java
import java.util.*;
```

To suppress this behaviour, go to File > Settings > Code Style > Java > Imports, set the two values in the rectangle to 9999.

<img width="738" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d2e593d-2f40-458a-993f-46e8ab37942d">

If you want to limit the scope of this supression within the project only, you can change the scheme on top to Project before making the above changes. This way, other IntelliJ projects won't be affected and will still auto-collapse imports.

When I was reading the quoted statement I was quite confused as why two classes with no references to each other can still be associated. It seems to me that such an 'association' is meaningless, as the code wouldn't change whether the association exists or not (since no attributes are added).

I was more perplexed when I read an earlier statement:

> An association can be shown as an attribute instead of a line.

This suggests that an association should result in new attributes being created, which makes it navigable.

This leads me to the question: do associations without navigability actually exist, and if so, what are some real-life examples where such associations are necessary and meaningful?

@damithc Got it! I now realize that I misunderstood the text. A more accurate interpretation is that associations imply navigability, and vice versa, though navigability can be either unidirectional or bidirectional (or simply not shown).

One suggestion I have is to consider making your `find` command case-insensitive. This allows more flexibility and will make the command even more useful.

Hi, Windows user here! It works well for me. Just some minor edge case issues:
- The `list` message when the tasklist is empty contains a typo (Sire -&gt; Sir)
- The program crashes on `deadline` and `event` commands with empty description or date

You might want to make your parser more robust and display error messages in such situations. 

Apart from these, great job! 👍  The archive feature is really helpful when the task list becomes messy.

Windows user here. The GUI opens up fine on my laptop and all the features work as intended! I noted some edge cases that could be handled more elegently:
- A more user-friendly message can be displayed for wrong date format;
- Currently having slashes in the description will lead to an exception message being displayed. Maybe you can display 'please remove slashes in your task description' instead?

By the way, there's a misplaced slash in the deadline command format section of the user guide.

That said, overall it's an excellent product!

@damithc Hi prof, is there any way to fix this? I dont wish for this to be a problem in the future. Something that I thought might cause this issue is that my nus email is linked to raynerlimfangyuh account and my own gmail is linked to my current rayray39 account.
However, in git, using `git config --global user.email` the email is my nus email while the name is rayray39. Could this be the cause? And will it be solved if i change the git email to my own gmail account?

Hi prof @damithc , thanks for the feedback. But why would the user want to keep track of things that is already over? Wouldnt it make more sense for the user to only keep track of deadlines that are in the future? (eg. upcoming assignments, approaching meetings etc.)?

The main problem i think with magical literal is poor readabilily.
So I think it is ok if the literals are self-explanatory.
Here is part of my code
```java
public String execute() ``{``
        if (taskList.size() < index || index <= 0) ``{``
            return printMessages("Sorry~ Can not delete this task as such task does not exist.");
        ``}`` else ``{``
            Task task = taskList.remove(modify(index));
            storage.updateFile(taskList);
            return printMessages(new String[]``{``"OK~. I've deleted this task:", task.toString(),
                    String.format("Now you have %s tasks in the list", taskList.size())``}``);
        ``}``
    ``}``
```
Although some strings may seem magical. But I think it is ok to leave it like that since readers are able to understand the meaning of these codes.

Your argument is reasonable. A bit more context here. Actually, the class name is called "SortCommand" and it extends from an abstract class called "Command". The execute would be to execute the command. This execute function should always do only sort the list and tell the user that the list is sorted. If I want to do other actions, I will creat a new command class. So I think it is self-explanatory.

Hi I am bit confused by level 8 requirements. In level 8, command lines with date e.g. "deadline return book /by 2/12/2019 1800" should be accepted and processed correctly.

Prior to level 8, the deadline format is "deadline return book /by Sunday". Will this format still be accepted in level 8, using the LocalDate.now() way? It seems that I have to adjust my testing script as well.

Since I was using regex for command, there was definitely a big change for me.

If your terminal is using Java19, there's a chance your current `$JAVA_HOME` points to that particular version of Java instead of the one you have to use, and it might be beneficial to change that for the rest of the module, at the very least.

Yep you are right! I modified ~/.zshrc file to set my $JAVA_HOME variable later. By the way, SDKMAN is quite good at managing the version of Java.

To add on, I have found other multiplicity notations like '2..*'. So I assume for Q2, the answer is that an main object can be linked to 1 or any number(more than 1) of person objects.

Later on, during the iP evaluation (which has a peer evaluation), you'll also get to evaluate the code quality and testing level of other iPs. This should serve as more practice. That said, we'll still give you some further code quality feedback later, after the iP is over. That will help you identify the things you missed yourself, and do an even better job in the tP.

Hi, I am in the process of setting-up gradle. However, I got an error message while loading it:

Your build is currently configured to use incompatible Java 17.0.11 and Gradle 6.2. Cannot sync the project.

We recommend upgrading to Gradle version 8.8.

The minimum compatible Gradle version is 7.2.

The maximum compatible Gradle JVM version is 13.

Possible solutions:
 - Upgrade to Gradle 8.8 and re-sync
 - Upgrade to Gradle 7.2 and re-sync
 - Use Java 13 as Gradle JVM: Open Gradle settings

For context, I used my project directory "/Users/vicelyavisakha/Documents/CS2103/INDIVIDUAL PROJECT" as my gradle user home. The java version for my computer is Azul zulu 17.10.11. 
Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

I was going through the "**AB3 Tutorial: Adding a Command**", under section "**Enhancing `RemarkCommand`**", and I clicked the [link](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/commit/dc6d5139d08f6403da0ec624ea32bd79a2ae0cbf#diff-a8e35af8f9c251525063fae36c9852922a7e7195763018eacec60f3a4d87c594) at the bottom of the section.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c7c77b3-0893-4b7b-8acc-bed445d0fee7)

In the import statements above, I noticed this line:

```
import static seedu.address.commons.core.Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT;
```

This line caused an error because Messages was not found in the logic package.
When I checked the AB3 code, there doesn't seem to have the Messages class either.
Instead, following the intellij suggestion, I replaced the above line with this line:

```
import static seedu.address.logic.Messages.MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT;
```

It seems to work when I run the code, at least up till my current section.

May I check if anyone encountered this issue before and if it is ok to make such a replacement?

I used source tree, and pushed to both the master branch and origin branch of my remote server for Level-4. I checked and ensured that the tags are named correctly. I think I only pushed to master for the previous levels. On my github repo, master is my main branch.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Typo/Deprecated example for Gradle Dependencies**
</div>

Site: [Gradle Tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html)

Under "Managing plugins and dependencies" section in the Gradle tutorial website, there's an example on how to add the "natty" dependency:
```
compile group: 'com.joestelmach', name: 'natty', version: '0.6'
```
"compile" doesn't work for me and a quick search says that it is no longer supported, and we should use "implementation" instead.

implementation group: 'com.joestelmach', name: 'natty', version: '0.6'

Not an expert but I've also done the same a few times 

I would stash the changes, switch to the intended branch, then apply the stashed changes. [Link to forum explaining this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5964118/git-working-on-wrong-branch-how-to-copy-changes-to-existing-topic-branch)

Regarding sourcetree not tracking progress, you probably just have to refresh sourcetree (F5 works for me)

I believe the program starts checking from your root folder (should be the "ip" folder). So it's possible that some other part of your code is creating a test.txt file in that folder.

@Judy1x4 Hi. I suspect what happened is that you committed those 2 files before updating your .gitignore. So those files will continue being tracked despite specifically updating to ignore it afterwards.

What you can do is:
1. first commit all current changes (to be safe)
2. run ```git rm --cached build.gradle data/jude.txt``` 
3. commit 

And hopefully it works!

Another possibility is due to your console output using CRLF line break instead of just LF

try replacing your \n with \r\n in your test function and see how it goes?

Hi. Please correct me if I get this wrong :p
Q1) I would say yes? No specific rules are broken from (a) due to the lack of information.

Q2) n...m notation you can think of it as a range from n to m (inclusive). So for the given example:

- Every Main object can have 1 to * (any number) of Person objects. Since the minimum is 1, you can also read this as "1 or more".
- For Person object its not specified, so I don't know if you can just assume it be 1 by default, because you should consider the possibility of setting references to `null`.

Maybe the Height of the HBox which contains your Label is preventing the overflow from occurring and results in the ellipsis.

Try messing around with the HBox attributes? I'm new to JavaFx too so it's just a guess.

I noticed in your Storage class you have this "return empty list on failure" when trying to load tasks. 
It might be possible that "corrupted/invalid" files end up getting wiped completely. Maybe tinker around that part of the logic to see if anything gets better?

Personally, I feel that GUI testing is best done by sharing it with others and letting them give feedback (how it feels, intuitive or not, etc..)

That’s because I believe that GUI is meant to enhance user experience, and should not hinder the main app functionality, so human user feedback would be best.

JUnit mainly tests functionality such as methods, so it’ll be difficult to write “useful/worth-it” tests for GUI, since for GUI it’s easier to just eyeball and test it yourself. Maybe looking at relevant apps to seeing how they did their GUI, and implementing what you find good might be more useful :p

Also interested in hearing what others think about GUI testing though!

I think it's because perhaps I tag the wrong stuff in the past. Should I delete the orginal tag that shows below here and then push the merge commit to the remote origin or just simply leave it there?

And this is how I construct the date parser:

```Java
    private static DateTimeFormatter[] getDateTimeFormatters() ``{``
        DateTimeFormatter[] formatters = ``{``
                //handle suffix (st, rd, etc)
                DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("d['st']['nd']['rd']['th'] MMM yyyy"),
                DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("d/M/yyyy"),
                DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy/M/d"),
                DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-M-d"),
                DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("d-M-yyyy")
        ``}``;
        return formatters;
    ``}``
```
```Java
public static LocalDate parseDate(String input) throws InvalidDateFormatException ``{``
        LocalDate parsedDate = null;

        //get dates for next week
        Map<String, LocalDate> map = buildMap();

        parsedDate = map.get(input.toLowerCase());

        if (parsedDate != null) ``{``
            return parsedDate;
        ``}``

        DateTimeFormatter[] formatters = getDateTimeFormatters();

        for (DateTimeFormatter formatter : formatters) ``{``
            try ``{``
                parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(input, formatter);
                break; // Exit loop if parsing is successful
            ``}`` catch (DateTimeParseException e) ``{``
                // Continue to the next format if parsing fails
                // hence the catch block here is leaved empty
            ``}``

            try ``{``
                parsedDate = LocalDate.parse(input + " " + LocalDate.now().getYear(), formatter);
                break;
            ``}`` catch (DateTimeParseException e) ``{``
                // throws the exception and return null if parsing fails
                // the exception will be handled at Elysia
            ``}``
        ``}``

        checkValidDateInput(parsedDate);

        return parsedDate;
    ``}``
```

This was given in the BCD extensions page
Archiving items

Provide a way to archive items so that the user can remove items from the app but still keep a record of them somewhere e.g., archive all tasks in the list into a file so that the user can start over with a clean slate.

So it stores all the tasks and preserve their respective states. Then it removes them from the current class list.

I think taskList is most descriptive, and tasks follows the plural convention as it stores multiple tasks. Personally I would follow taskList as it gives clear indication of what it is.

Regarding the bye function, no it does not automatically exit as of now

And for the commands, it can be seen by typing `help`. But thank you for the suggestion to display it when the user opens the application!

Thank you so much.

Regarding the `bye` command, i have made it a command now to facilitate easy exit of the programme.

In CS2030 (the version taught by Prof Henry Chia) he advocates for all objects to be made immutable. For eg. if you want to change a `Task` object from being not-done to done, you should return a `new Task` rather than by modifying the boolean attribute tracking the "doneness" of the task. This makes the coding "safer" as there's no risk of accidentally changing the state / value of objects during runtime, but also makes it harder to program as the object changes after each state change (and the new object needs to slot into the place of the old one).

I would consider this a magical literal as it is not too clear what context in which this message is sent. Especially since the method is `execute` and not `sort`, is it not _too_ self-explanatory that this method should sort and print out a corresponding message. 

The way I would think of it is this - if I were to write this in a company and later leave the company, the next person working on the codebase should understand what to put there and change the message if necessary should the `execute` function change in its output / functionality later 🙂 

Though, happy to hear what others might think of this!

May be helpful:
If you are on Windows machine, run runtest.bat in */text-ui-test/ directory, and you **will not** expecting "Test result: PASSED" or "Test result: FAILED" outputs, you will only see the output from FC command.
If your are on *nix machine, run runtest.sh in */text-ui-test/ directory, and you **will** be expecting to see "Test result: PASSED" or "Test result: FAILED" outputs.
The 2 scripts are written differently, so they will not print the same set of outputs.

One use case can be using varargs for command parameter. E.g., event 123 /from startDate /to endDate, you can set the parameter for your command object constructor as String..., and you will use the constructor by passing "event", "123", "startDate", "endDate" as the parameters.

Hi Prof, it has been 2 days and no one else has a answer for my last comment. May I just clarify do we stick to https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html **strictly**, i.e. I should not put blank lines between custom import (to separate the imports by my packages) because these imports belongs to "all other imports"? If I follow the style strictly, is it fine if my custom imports look like this (note, these imports are in my Parser class, which requires all command objects and handle exceptions):

```
import command.ByeCommand;
import command.Command;
import command.DeadlineCommand;
import command.DeleteCommand;
import command.EventCommand;
import command.FindCommand;
import command.ListCommand;
import command.MarkCommand;
import command.TodoCommand;
import command.UnmarkCommand;
import exception.BlitzCommandDoesNotExistException;
import exception.BlitzException;

> @gohsl99 Yes, the easiest solution seems to be to just remove the blank line. But you may change the checkstyle configuration too, if you wish. If you do the latter, you are likely to run into the same issue in the tP, and you'll need the team's consensus to change the checkstyle config.

I believe the coding guidelines don't specify that the override statement should be its own line. However, conventionally override is placed above the method like in the 2nd example. I think either method is valid as far as standards for the course, but override being a separate line is better for readability.

@SlothyCat thank you for smoke testing. Yeah for the tag I don't throw an error when # isn't included.

I think you can correct this by forking your team's repo now and then cloning your fork. 

To do a PR push changes to your fork. When you go to your fork on github website it will suggest creating a PR. You can click on that, if it doesn't suggest can read back material on how to create a PR. 

Even if you do not fork the repo you should still be able to create a PR but the PR will be from a branch to main branch in the main repo. This is called the feature workflow whereby all team members push to branches in the main repo while working and then create a PR from that branch to main. However, until tp V1.3 we are meant to follow the forking workflow so for now just fork and flow the forking workflow.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Completed `A-Assertions` and `A-CodeQuality` with wrong branch name**

I've completed the features `A-Assertions` and `A-CodeQuality`, but unfortunately I have labelled their branches `A-Assertions` and `A-CodeQuality` instead of the required `branch-A-Assertions` and `branch-A-CodeQuality`. As such they correctly show up as red in my progress tracker.

**2. :fas-info-circle: Variable scope in `switch`**
</div>

I've noticed that variables declared in the `case` block of a `switch` share the same scope.

For example,

```Java
switch (command) ``{``

case MarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new MarkCommand(taskList, id);

case UnmarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new UnmarkCommand(taskList, id);

``}``
```

if you try to compile and run this, there will be an error `Duplicate local variable id`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f4c37b7-c99a-4784-971e-0a51a6178450)

Currently, my workaround this issue is to introduce a closure by adding ```{````}``` around the `case` block, like in the code snippet below. This is quite readable in my opinion as it does not really disrupt the original flow of code. I believe it is also compliant with checkstyle since `./gradlew checkstyleMain` does not give me any errors.

```Java
switch (command) ``{``

case MarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD: ``{``
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new MarkCommand(taskList, id);
``}``

case UnmarkCommand.COMMAND_WORD: ``{``
    int id = Integer.parseInt(rest) - 1;
    return new UnmarkCommand(taskList, id);
``}``

``}``
```

Are there other ways to handle this issue? Is this method reasonable?

I understand that working with parallel branches can lead to merge conflicts, and I see the value in practicing how to resolve them.

However, I have dealt with merge conflicts before, so if possible I would not like to purposely introduce merge conflicts for practice, so I'm asking if I can do these branches one by one in sequential order.

hm, i made my build.gradle file exactly the same as yours, but I am still facing the same issue. Is it possible that the problem is coming from a file that is not build.gradle?

Hi, I am currently using the `checkstyle.xml` from AB3.

import javafx.scene.Scene;

Does anyone know how I can edit the `checkstyle.xml` file in order to achieve this? Thank you!

**3. :fas-info-circle: Level-7: Clarification on when to write to file**
</div>

According to the Level-7 task description, "Save the tasks in the hard disk automatically whenever the task list changes."

May I ask if it is necessary to write to file whenever the user add, mark, unmark, delete a task? I think it is quite inefficient to write to file for every change as I/O operations are slow. Is it ok for my implementation to be such that the tasks are only saved to file when the user exit the program (ie. `"bye"`).

Thanks everyone for your inputs! 

My initial thoughts was similar to what @cth06-Github had mentioned, to use Enums for commands however, it seemed unnecessary and makes the code more convoluted (at least in my opinion). Hence, I was wondering if the fact that I had difficulty seeing how Enums can be incorporated is due to bad code design on my part. 

@MAOXIONGKAI I think what you suggested makes a lot of sense, especially the part about statuses which might be relevant even for increments up till week 2. Thanks a lot!

Hi, you may refer to issue  #21. I think it is not necessary to move the tag.

However, if you do wish to do so, you may do
``` 
git tag -d [tag]
git tag [tag]
```

you will need to delete the original tag since it is not permitted to have the same tag on multiple commits.

@Incogdino I think that is a valid concern. However, considering that a program crashing due to Exceptions is not supposed to be a frequent occurrence, the only other reason I can think of right now where a program terminates without `"bye"` is when the user close the terminal (similar to clicking "X" on a window when the app has a GUI). 

Not sure if there is a better way to save the data, but I am current storing it in a `.txt` file with `','` delimiter. 
ie.
```
T,0,borrow book
D,1,return book,Sunday
E,0,project meeting,Mon 2pm,4pm
...
```

suppose the task list were to get large, and I were to update the file for the 30th item out of 100, there is no way (I don't think so?) to selectively change that particular line other than rewriting all the other tasks again. That would mean not just the writing to file but also looping through `n items` in my `ArrayList` and appending them to string (at least for my implementation).

If we have to account for the unexpected termination of program, I think a `save` command feature might be a way to mitigate such situations, though not a direct solution as it does not solve the issue of "unexpected".

without code snippets it is hard to pinpoint the problem, but a possible reason might be the relative path. one way to start debugging is to specify a different path for your test storage. for example, my Storage uses ./data/tasks.txt but for StorageTest, it uses ./tmp/tasks.txt and then observe where the folders are initialised

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡RTFM for launcher**
</div>

I didn't RTFM for the javaFX tutorial provided in week 3. Turns out the reason we have to use a launcher class is due to how the JVM access paths for the javaFX library after modules were introduced. I never wrote a launcher class and I wasted a fair amount of time not understanding why the JVM was unable to find the appropriate libraries given the DLLs were packaged into the jar.

Fair warning to anyone who is facing this issue.

@damithc Could you share what is the frequency of the job? Would there be any additional considerations to running the job more frequently?

Edit: I read some the [reposense](https://reposense.org/index.html) documentation, seems like this is a program looks at all the public forks to generate a report and the dashboard repo triggers a job that runs this report generator and deploys it to the webpage. Is there rate limiting going on that prevents more frequent deploys?

You shouldn't need to modify the script to get your tests to work. The actual output should tally with your expected output. How did you generate the expected output? Did you paste from the clipboard or did you redirect the output?

>I think it is quite inefficient to write to file for every change as I/O operations are slow

Unless got few hundred concurrent requests, what are the chances it will actually be inefficient currently? File I/O is already quite efficient (see SQLite).

The value of logging correct atomic transactions seem to outweigh efficiency in this case not only because basically few people are using it, but also the task list is performing the function of book keeping, which is essentially an extremely basic database.

IMO, if you are at the point where speed of I/O operations matter, you can consider offloading that responsibility to a DB solution.

Personally, I just did the minimum to satisfy the requirement.

Edit: Thinking about your question, perhaps a better question to ask is how can i design the code such that I can provide an interface for my code to talk to, such that I don't care about the I/O implementation (algorithm implementation). For that, you can consider some design patterns like Adapter pattern or strategy pattern. But whether or not it is worth the effort to write that into code for a simpler problem like this, is debatable. It depends on your personal objectives.

This should be correct. What's the point of testing implementation? A significant point of writing tests is to ensure that when code changes, behaviour doesn't. Testing the contract makes more sense.

Regardless of what you did, the git SHAs will still persist in the git DB for a period of time before the git GC removes it permanently.

The standard way of retrieving is to use `reflog` for that specific branch and find the SHA.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Looking for helpful classmates to test .jar file!**
</div>

Hi all,

I'm looking for anyone who is keen to help me test my .jar file, particular on a Windows machine! Steps are as listed below:

1. Download the `casper.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/yizhong187/ip/releases/download/A-Release/casper.jar).
2. Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the .jar file.
3.  Run the application using the following command:
```bash
java -jar casper.jar
```
4. A command prompt will open, allowing you to enter commands such as list, sort, find, and more.
Here are some example commands you can try:
`list`: Lists all tasks.
`todo buy milk`: Adds a new todo task with the description “buy milk”.
`mark 1`: Marks the first task as complete.

Feel free to refer to my [user guide](https://yizhong187.github.io/ip/) for all features and leave a comment below to let me know if it works well or not!

Thank you!

 ``}``
```

When attempting the MoreOOP Increment, I notice this example, where a new Ui object is instantiated, and the `showLoadingError` method was called from that object. However, assuming the `showLoadingError` method does not require any instance variable from the object, is it acceptable to set it as a static method that can be used without the instantiation of an object?

Consequently, is it okay for me to have a PrintUtils class in a utils package that contains only static methods that are used for outputting message to the user?

@Incogdino `showLoadingError` would not display a custom error depending on the type of exception thrown, and is stateless (I assume, based on the fact that nothing was passed/done to the Ui object). However, it is made an instance method, instead of a static one, and that is breaking my expectation of:

@Incogdino LOL (can I say that in the forum 🤣 ) I think we understand each other, I am just pointing out the fact that `showLoadingError` does not correspond with **our common understanding**  that stateless methods should be declared as static. Anyways thanks for your help and discussion :)

**1. :fas-info-circle: Association Classes vs Dependencies**
</div>

Hi just wanted to clarify what the main difference is between Association Classes and Dependencies:

From my understanding, Dependencies are classes that does not store a reference to any other classes but relies on other classes to perform certain tasks and association is referred to classes that does in fact store references to other classes.

The following is a quote from the lecture notes on the course website that I have pasted for reference:
> Dependencies vs associations:
> 
> An association is a relationship resulting from one object keeping a reference to another object (i.e., storing an object in an instance variable). While such a relationship forms a dependency, we need not show that as a dependency arrow in the class diagram if the association is already indicated in the diagram. That is, showing a dependency arrow does not add any value to the diagram.
>
> Similarly, an inheritance results in a dependency from the child class to the parent class but we don't show it as a dependency arrow either, for the same reason as above.
>
> Use a dependency arrow to indicate a dependency only if that dependency is not already captured by the diagram in another way (for instance, as an association or an inheritance) e.g., class Foo accessing a constant in Bar but there is no association/inheritance from Foo to Bar.


My question is, in the photo pasted below for reference, doesn't the association class act like a dependency class as well? It does not store any references of other classes as shown in the example, rather just a utility base Class to store just a `startDate` and `returnDate` in example.

Dependencies:

# JUnit / Gradle Build Dependency issue

Hi I keep on getting this same error message when trying to run JUnit:

```
error: package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test
                            &hat;
```

It pops up under Build Output, I have double check my Gradle dependencies to make sure that it is using the right JUnit dependencies, it is, but not sure where to go from here.

```java
dependencies ``{``
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
``}``
```

I searched online and one suggestion was to click the reload all Gradle projects button found in the Gradle menu. That ended up turning my `@Test` annotation red, along with the following imports turning to grey and the words "Test" and "Assertions" turning red, which I am guessing those are needed but somehow removed perhaps?

Hi prof, I tried the first bullet point but, it did not fix the issue.

However, I think I know where I went wrong. I attempted the second bullet point and copied and pasted my Test.java code, so if I understand correctly, I think when typing the @Test annotation, and how automatically Java asks if you would like to add JUnit. I may have selected "Add JUnit 5.8.1 to class path", which I am guessing might be the cause of the issue since I am suppose to use JUnit 5.10.

However, in my clone fork, after clicking on the @Test, the only options I am given for resolving are as follows:
- Add JUnit 4 to class path
- Add JUnit 5.8.1 to class path
- Add testing to class path
- Create another test
- Change access modifier
- Try to resolve class reference

There isn't any option specifically for JUnit 5.10.0

Yup I agree with the previous comment, you can look at Parser being solely responsible for processing the input. You can reference the example provided in `run()` under `A-MoreOOP Stretch Goal`. Notice how it is receiving a `String fullCommand` that you can get from the `ui` instance. After which it then returns an instance of `Command c` in this case. The `Ui` class for me is solely responsible for receiving inputs and printing outputs.

For me personally, I decided to use `Enums` with my `Parser` Class to match the string inputs to the range of commands that exist, though I am sure there are better ways to do this.

Ahh I see, so dependencies are just relationships rather than looked at as a class itself. I thought a Dependency Class was an actual thing, similar to an Association Class.

With that being said the Association Class itself has a dependency relationship to the other classes they are linked to, just that they represent the association itself. So based on the examples shown above, `Loan` represents the association between `Student` borrowing `Book` where as `PreviewGenerator` does not represent any association, but is mainly there just to perform certain operations making it dependent on other classes, the key point here would be that in that example, `PreviewGenerator` does not represent any association relationship but is dependent on `Chapter`, whereas `Loan` represents the association relationship between `Student` and `Book` and thus also making it dependent to both of those classes as well?

Would this be correct?

For me personally the way I did it was adding on an if statement in their `handleUserInput()` method as referenced in their tutorial notes by checking if the `String response` that you get from your `getResponse()` method from your `Duke` instance contains the word `Bye`, I just added something like the following:

```java
// Stop the JavaFX application from running after bye command
if (response.contains("Bye")) ``{``

</div>

I am working with one of my teammates for one of the features our team has decided to add to AB3 this week.

We're slightly unsure about how to go about the tp workflow in this context.

My initial thought was to a create a branch called 'add-said-feature', commit a small bit of code that doesn't break the 
team repo, and create a PR. There would then hopefully be a way for my teammate to track this branch and make his changes to it and update the same PR. Then we could simultaneously communicate to incrementaly integrate the feature bit by bit. Is there a way to do this? Is this even aligning with the required workflow for the tp right now?

Another thought was to create branches for these bits and pieces of each feature. For instance, I would create a branch called 'add-said-feature-step1', commit and get it merged. Then my teammate would push the branch 'add-said-feature-step2' and get it merged, and so on. All these branches would have to make sure they don't break the code in the main repo.

I used AI tools to complete tasks I consider menial because it is quite clear to me how it should be done and what standards should be maintained. Such tasks include writing Javadoc comments or assisting with considering edge cases for testing the to-do list application using Junit in the IP. It saves time, but also enables us to replicate real world programming in the modern day. In my experience so far, even full time SWEs use AI to complete similar tasks, so it makes sense to take advantage of the opportunity to train this practice in a SWE course.

From my understanding, I missed step 3.4 in the instructions. After merging master (with changes pulled from the first PR) into my second branch, I did not push the updated branch to the remote. Is this correct? Or did I miss something else?

**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡Duke Level-1: Easily add optional indentations**
</div>

Hey guys I was looking around the web and Java documentation and found an interesting method that may be useful with adding the optional indentation.

Many would accomplish this by manually adding indentation to their string and print it out, for instance:
```java
System.out.println("    " + HORIZONTAL_LINE);
System.out.println("     Hello! I'm your friendly chat bot, how can I help you?");
```

But perhaps you have another function that produces a String with multiple lines:
```java
public static String createTwoLineString() ``{``
    // no way of adding space when printing? or is it
    return "first line\nsecond line";
``}``
```

Instead of rewriting the function to add spaces on new lines, you can use the [`String::indent(int)`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#indent(int)) method which adds the specified number of spaces at the front of each line instead.
```java
System.out.println(createTwoLineString().indent(4)); // prints the string with 4 spaces infront of each line
```

If you instead wish to add a prefix of mixed characters (eg: `"\t "` - tab and a space) instead of just spaces, you can instead write a function that uses the [`String::lines()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#lines()) method which converts the `String` into a `Stream<String>` and apply Stream methods to add the prefix to the start of each line and combine into one String, or use the [`String.split("\n")`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)) method which returns an array of String of the lines of the String and use some iterative approach (I recommend using [`StringBuilder`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StringBuilder.html)) to create a new String with the prefix appended at each line.

I think what @Incogdino has said is pretty much the gist of it. 

One point not that was brought up but not explicitly mentioned by @Incogdino is that git prefers to a do fast-forward merge (if possible) over a regular merge commit when using the `git merge branch_name` command and using the `--no-ff` flag forces git to create a merge commit; if you have two branches which both already have additional commits, `git merge` will create a merge commit as it is not possible to do a create fast-forward merge.

I think the video in the topics section ([Tools -&gt; Git and GitHub -&gt; branch: doing multiple parallel changes](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week3/topics.html#tools-git-and-github-branch-doing-multiple-parallel-changes)) is pretty good in explaining how to do both types of merges using SourceTree. If you prefer to use the git CLI you can refer to `CLI` tab in the text sections or you can search for the multiple available videos on this topic on Youtube.

I assume you are using Windows, and it looks like your `JAVA_HOME` path variable is incorrectly set up?

First you want to go to your path variables, you can do this by searching `Edit the system environment variables` in Windows search bar which brings you to a `System Properties` window.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb919c11-1938-41a6-879f-ff98f4abc4bd)

Then click `Environment Variables` which brings you to the `Environment Variables` window.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6eeb5585-73ad-485c-a8ff-b2b08a243bb9)

Then under the `System Variables` section, look in the `Variable` tab for `JAVA_HOME`.

![Screenshot 2024-08-31 145543](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee77a01-c74f-4100-a38b-24f11470b89b)

In there you should be able to change it to the Java 17 SDK probably called `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17`, you can double click the row to edit it and then after changing it press `Ok`.

In addition, if you want to **rename** your tag, you first tag the commit with the new tag with `git tag ``{``new-tag``}`` ``{``commit-hash``}``` and the remove the old tag using `git tag -d ``{``old-tag``}``` and then remove your old tag from your remote repository.

To remove the old tag from your remote repository:
```sh
# remove old tag from remote repository
git push --delete origin :ref/tags/``{``old-tag``}``

Another way to get the font name (at least **on Windows**) without using code is by:
1. Right click on the font file (`.otf`/`.ttf`/etc) in file explorer
1. Go to `Details` tab
1. Look for the `Title` row in the `Property` column and the name should be in the `Value` column on the same row.

Alternatively, you can just open the font file (double click) and then the name should be on the top at `Font name: ``{``font name``}```.

When I try to run your jar file using `java -jar xxx.jar`, the following output is shown :
```
Error: Could not find or load main class shoai.Main

I think your `gradle.build` file might not be properly configured. I also tried building your project on my local machine, but it seems that you put emoji literals into Java strings which causes Java to scream at me since this is not supported on windows.

hello I have tested your ip, to me only 2 commands came in trouble, which are the "load" and "archive" commands in need  of more instruction, as a user at first I didn't realize that I have to open the folder and check the file name. I was quite lost and wondering what do you mean by "archive file name with extension", at the time when I was trying to use this command. Probably give my function on archive command so that user can choose their own filename instead of checking them by themselves. Or add some new command to check what archives do they have right now.

Swapping out the website links to the correct ones in the docs and site.json files doesn't seem to help much either.

We have decided to use MarkBind if that is relevant, and have set the Github Pages to key off the gh-pages branch. Thanks!

I assume that

2) Constructor, and everything but getters/setters and overrided methods inherited from above needs one (at the top, no blank lines in beteen); you can autogenerate those using the relevant guide. The top sentence needs to be a brief summary of what it does, a blank line, and then the rest of the @ notations.

Is that correct? Couldn't quite find examples or a very clear example of requirements anywhere, thanks.

Shouldn't we draw it as well or is this already implied by the dependency of ActionFactory to History?

Also in another example, if we put composition relationship that an email HAS-A body, why is 0 allowed? I thought composition referred to a strong ownership where if an email is created, it must have a body. Here, if email can live without body, won't it be similar to aggregation instead?

**3. :fas-info-circle: Sequence diagrams: Asynchronous call vs Parallel**
</div>

This question might be out of the syllabus scope but I just want to know more about the difference between lined arrowheads vs par frames. 

In the textbook, it is stated that lined arrowheads are used for asynchronous calls. It is also stated under the advanced section that we can use par frames to describe parallel paths. May I know if there is a difference in using lined arrowheads vs par frames? Or to put in another way, are there scenarios where one would be more suitable than another? To me, both seems to be indicating some sort of parallelism in the program.

**4. :fas-info-circle: Accidentally created a branch off another branch instead of master**
</div>

While doing this week's iP task. I seem to have accidentally created another branch off another branch. This led to this outcome which does not seem to match the ones shown in the project task:
<img width="527" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdc965ca-4d7a-4991-bf1e-b5fa8f5ba67b">

Based on the picture it seems like I created branch-A-Assertions off of branch-A-CodeQuality but checking my git bash history, it seems to be the other way round:
<img width="253" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acb06e1c-0a81-491b-9bc9-bdb6393539f3">

(ignore branch-A-Streams because I deleted it)
What is the appropriate way to fix this issue given that I have already pushed some of the branches into my remote repo?

**5. :fas-info-circle: UML Diagrams: Bidirectional vs opposite unidirectional associations**
</div>

From the textbook, it seems that two opposite two unidirectional associations between two classes does not always result in a bidirectional association. This was illustrated by the example:
```
class Person ``{``
    Cat pet;
    //...
``}``

class Cat``{``
    Person breeder;
    //...
``}``
```
I interpreted this as a class diagram like this:
<img width="344" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2a84b20-a80a-475c-9c80-c4a2b82f4b2c">

Then, another example showcasing bidirectional association was given by this example:
```
class Dog ``{``
    Man man;
    // ...
``}``

class Man ``{``
    Dog dog;
    // ...
``}``
```

So with these two examples we see that simply having a class `B` attribute in class `A` and a class `A` attribute in class `B` might not always result in bidirectional association. In the first example, we say that the breeder might not be the owner of the pet so we separate the associations. Yet, in example 2, it does not seem quite apparent to me that the "`man`" and "`dog`" are referring to the same association. The `man ` in `Dog` could refer to the owner/breeder, etc.

I am not sure if it is correct but my take on this is that the attributes should be named in a way that provides the context so that a clear association can be established. If i renamed the `breeder` to `person` in the first example, how would I know if the association is bidirectional or two separate associations?

**7. :fas-info-circle: Requirement of Java packages to match folder path**
</div>

In the textbook, it is stated that: "Furthermore, the package of a type should match the folder path of the source file.". I am a bit confused about the wording of this sentence. What exactly does "type" refer to? It has also been used throughout the section on Java packages. I am guessing that it is referring to a Java file?

Do correct me if my understanding is wrong. How I understand and interpret the statement is as follows:
If i have a Java class/file "Abc" that belongs to the package "example.myfile", "Abc.java" must be placed in the folder path "src/example/myfile/Abc.java".

If my understanding is correct, may I ask why must this be the case? What is the purpose of needing packages' names to follow the folder path of where the file is?

Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application

Upon further inspection it appeared although i have javafx.controls included in the dependency list, it's not included in the fatjar when running clean shadowjar, for some unknown reason. 

The solution (or hack) to bypass this problem as mentioned in the article is to have an extra starter class to avoid starting from the original main class that extends Application.

IMO it is appropriate to commit changes made for the same purpose e.g. multiple new files created to implement a new function, together; On the other hand it would be beneficial to commit changes made in the same file but for different purposes separately, so it's easy to identify where problem may come from when issues arise.

Instead of

I posted an issue yesterday mentioning one probable cause of this problem(and I'm getting tagged for this issue what an amazing algorithm behind this), that if your entry point extends Application you might run into this error. The solution is to have a separate entry class that doesn't extend Application. This was mentioned in AB3 as pointed by someone else so I closed the issue. Hope it helps.

Hello I have just made the fix from the guide to change the entry point and have just made a new release. It works on my groupmate's computer but could any of you guys test it again to make sure?
https://github.com/WuJinhan1/ip/releases/tag/A-Gradle
Also I have it tagged under a different tag since the original A-Release tag was taken, is that fine?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Difference between the expected and actual error message because of use of emoji**
</div>

Hi, for the IP peer review, there was a question asking what the output was after you type foo 2. For my own chat bot, my message is actually this - "`I don't undestand what you mean.. (˚ ˃̣̣̥⌓˂̣̣̥ )`". I included an 'emoji' without knowing that we would need to be marked based on this. I don't think the reviewer will be able to copy this emoji when they fill out the review form for me. Since you can't select and copy on the chatbot interface itself. As such, would I be penalised because my error message is different if my peer reviewer is unable to input the emoji part of the message, which result in a difference between the expected output and the actual output?

**3. :fas-info-circle: FileWriter unable to write to text file**
</div>

I'm facing issues when trying to write to an external file from my program. The program finishes executing without throwing an error however when I check my text file, it is still blank, when instead, it should have the line hello world. Currently, inside my java folder, I have both my txt file test.txt and my program file Dawn.java. I'm using IntelliJ as my IDE. And I call saveTasks as such `saveTasks("./test.txt");` before exiting the program. I am unsure why my program does not write to the file as intended.. 

```java 
private static void saveTasks(String filePath) throws DawnException, IOException ``{``
        FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filePath);
        try ``{``
            fw.write("hello world");
            fw.close();
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            throw new DawnException("Something went wrong: " + e.getMessage());
        ``}``
    ``}``

> I believe the program starts checking from your root folder (should be the "ip" folder). So it's possible that some other part of your code is creating a test.txt file in that folder.

Hi @Domokunx, just to clarify, why might another part of the code create a test.txt file when I specified for FileWriter to open the one I created inside the java directory? Upon checking, I actually see another test.txt file being created inside the ip folder but outside the java folder. And this one contains the hello world line. How should I adjust the file path to make the program write to the specific test.txt file that I created? Thanks!

Hi, does that mean it's better to use relative paths like ./java/test.txt? But when I tried doing that, the program searches from the top of the repo from ip downwards and instead of accessing the test.txt file in the current directory, it creates a new file in the ip directory.

i.e 
is `event team meeting /from 10-10-2024 /to 10-10-2024` sufficient?
or would `event team meeting /from 10-10-2024 1800 /to 10-10-2024 1900` be required to hit the minimal requirement?

Hi @marchjlim 

This problem could be related to how IntelliJ is handling the project configuration as opposed to the code. 

1. Try `./gradlew clean build run`. And additionally try restarting your IDE for good measure. 
2. Try resetting Intellij's cache: **File** -&gt; **Invalidate Caches / Restart**
3. Go to your settings, go to **Build, Execution, and Deployment** -&gt; **Build tools** -&gt; **Gradle** and make sure that the build and run, and run tests are set to Gradle, and have not accidentally changed when you changed your commit. 

Another thing, when you say, 'run it on intellij', can I just confirm that you are using one of the methods mentioned [here?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6G3RyxEMk#t=13m44s) (i.e using the gradle window). 
Because if you are using the standard green run button, you might need to edit your Run configurations, by going to the drop down menu besides the run button, clicking **Edit configurations ... **, and look for the run configuration for the Main class. Click on it, and make sure that it points to the correct class. 

EDIT: Just a small note for point 3, in the same **Build tools** window, also just check that your Gradle JVM is set to the same version that you are using in terminal. (I got this tip from Issue #189, as recommended by @damithc in the subsequent comment)

You could check out this similar issue: #185 

Could I ask for some more details regarding this?

1. Firstly, did you submit everything on time? If so, this is likely a bug, but can you send a screenshot of your source tree branch merge details. This is to make sure you have merged everything correctly. 
2. Secondly, are you sure you pushed your local branches to the remote repository. If you didn't, you may have just pushed the tag and commit, and thus it won't identify your branches.

Hi @AbdulrahmanAlRammah 

I have had similar issues not just with this video, but a few different videos, sometimes it helps me to reload the page, then go back to that point, or restart the browser. It's frustrating, but I'm not sure whether there's a common fix for it.

Thanks for the clarification Prof @damithc, I understand the requirement now! For reference, I initially assumed events to be like conferences, i.e Media Conference from 10th sep to 13th sep, but later realised they might be as small as a meeting that lasts 2 hours.

Hi @jian7490, would you be able to copy the code and put it in a code block next time?

There definitely is a recurring error message saying : "have x86_64, need arm...", but before looking into those, do try the following:

1. Do the following command: `java -version` and make sure you have the correct java version as referenced by this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html). You need to have this exact version, and as they say in the guide,

**4. :fas-info-circle: Issue with List<String> in IntelliJ IDEA**
</div>

### Issue with `List<String>` in IntelliJ IDEA

**Environment:**
- IntelliJ IDEA version: 23
- Java version: 17

**Problem:**

I'm encountering an issue in IntelliJ IDEA where it red-underlines `List<String>` and prompts me to use the raw type `List` instead. The code snippet where this occurs is:

```java
List<String> strings = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/rapgod.txt"));  //error prompted
```

To resolve this, the only thing that works is using the fully qualified class name:

```java
java.util.List<String> strings = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/rapgod.txt"));
```

I already have the following import statement in my code:

```java
import java.util.List;
```

**Expected Behavior:**

I expect IntelliJ to recognize the `List<String>` type without needing to use the fully qualified class name, given that the import statement is already in place.

**Steps Taken:**

- Verified the import statement is correct.
- Restarted IntelliJ.

**Request:**

Could someone help me understand why this issue is occurring and how to resolve it? TIA!

Hello everyone, I appreciate all the detailed and quick replies. 

When I was going back to take a screenshot to attatch to this issue, I realised the problem. I had created my own 'List.java' to abstract the task list in the chatbot without realising that the name clashes with java's List.java (my bad)

I will change the class name to TaskList

## My applications of ChatGPT

### 1. Markdown File Generation 
I've used GPT to create README files, AI acknowledgements, or other documentation. This has saved me time and made my documentation look neater.

### 2. Javadoc Skeletons
I used GPT to create javadoc comment skeletons that include necessary annotations like `@link` and other decorators to create cross-references within the code (that I did not know about actually). After generating the initial structure, I can then go back and change some details if needed,

### 3. Generating Repetitive Code
I also used GPT to generate repetitive code, like class constructors that involve multiple fields or long snums.

There is a similar discussion linked [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/208). 

For the IP, I also believe that there is no point to defining a static variable for the task type, especially when it is used in 2 isolated methods and nowhere else. Perhaps within the javadocs remark that D is the short-form for Deadline so that people who are not familiar with this IP can understand what it means. 

On the flip-side, suppose that you want to change the format from "D" to "Deadline", you have to replace these 2 instances of the magic literal, which is doable. However, if we scale up the project more and have multiple instances of the task type utilized across the code-base, having a constant declared lets you change all these instances from one place.

> 1. Even though score of the team is discrete and finite, we may want to perform arithmetic operations on it, such as adding a score when the team wins a game or subtracting the score when the team receives a penalty, which is not supported by the enum type, (and just to add on, enum types are usually used for comparison, switch statements and other non-arithmetic operations) hence representing the team score using enum type variable is not appropriate.

Good point thanks.

Appreciate all the other responses as well, albeit some are not convincing answers. ``{``10000 can be considered small / inefficiency is not a concern / 10000 distinct values could each have a meaningful significance``}``

If you highlight the code there, it is using spaces. Go to Canvas and try for yourself

I completely understand that its not the **'\t'** char but **' '** char that is the standard, that which I agree with. Would like to highlight that it is possible by configuration of your IDE / editor, that the tab key's output can be changed to 4-spaces, hence easily misunderstood to be equivalent. I think the semantics of this question ought to be clearer.

Thanks for your help on testing my product. However, I tried on my end it seems to work as intended. Could I trouble any other mac users to test on this issue? Thanks

I closed a similar issue as I thought that I solved it, but it turns out that I am still unable to push in Sourcetree without having to provide an access key for my account. But if Im not wrong, the access token can only be accessed once.

Do I have to create another personal access token and use its password, or is there any other way to solve this issue?

Got it! But it was pretty weird that sourcetree suddenly gave a bad credentials error out of nowhere (it was working fine for the past few days). Could it be due to the github authentication changes that they made recently?

My first thought was to use enums as a way to manage logic flow for commands (`mark`, `unmark`, `todo`, etc.) and to handle the corresponding message for the Exception class. The use of switch-case rather than a huge chunk of if-else statements is a lot more readable imo!

Seems like it wasn't specified, but I don't see any reason not to include it for robustness. No harm with at least logging the default case or throwing an exception so the program doesn't silently fail.

Hi @arnav12344,

Try updating your `mainClass` attribute to `mainClass.set("Kayo.Kayo")` in `build.gradle` to correctly reference the class within its package.

On that note, the course convention is to use lower case for package names,  so do update the package name to `kayo`. 
After this change,  the `mainClass` attribute needs to be updated to  `mainClass.set("kayo.Kayo")` in `build.gradle` to reflect the new package name.

The final directory structure should look like this: `.../src/main/java/kayo/Kayo`, with the corresponding mainClass attribute set to `kayo.Kayo`.

@FlyingDonkeys Have you tried [reimporting the project](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/import-project-or-module-wizard.html#create-from-sources)? That should help to re-create the `.idea` folder (I think?)

Could you also share what steps you've already tried? It will make it easier to know what has or has not been tried yet.

If nothing else works, you could always clone the repository in a new directory with `git clone` and import it into IntelliJ.

> Will this affects encapsulation of the class? Also I tried using stubs but it seems quite weird to reimplement a lot of same classes in each class

Hmm, my train of thought was also to use mocks/stubs. You could extend the original class and override existing methods/write new methods that you need to control/inspect so I don't think there should be that much reimplementation.

Maybe you could try something like this?
```java
public class TaskListStub extends TaskList ``{``
    private List<Task> tasksStub = new ArrayList<>();
    
    // Override some existing method to modify behaviour for testing
    @Override
    public void addTask(Task task) ``{``
        tasksStub.add(task);
    ``}``
    
    // Additional method to check for the modified behaviour without
    // implementing a getter in TaskList to access private fields.
    public boolean wasTaskAdded(Task task) ``{`` 
        return tasksStub.contains(task);
    ``}``
``}``
```
The added method `wasTaskAdded()` avoids the use of a getter in the original `TaskList`. You could probably add similar methods to handle logic related to the private fields. Not sure if this is what you are looking for but hope this helps!

It seems that the warnings are due to the runners using outdated Node.js versions, rather than an issue with your code itself. Since the workflows are working fine, I'm pretty sure the warnings can be ignored.

However, if the warnings bothers you, you can avoid them by upgrading the versions in the `.yml` file:
1) [Upgrade gradle/wrapper-validation-action  to gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v4](https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action?tab=readme-ov-file)
2) [Upgrade setup-java to v2](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/blob/main/docs/switching-to-v2.md)

It should look something like this? (Copy at your own risk, untested)
```diff
 - name: Validate Gradle Wrapper
-  uses: gradle/wrapper-validation-action@v3
+  uses: gradle/actions/wrapper-validation@v4

 - name: Setup JDK 17
-  uses: actions/setup-java@v1
+  uses: actions/setup-java@v2

     java-version: '17'

Hi! Maybe you can try running the command using `./gradlew run --debug` on your terminal. You will likely be met with a very verbose output. Search for sections named [ERROR] and it would point to exact location of error and we can try and find out the solution to the problem from there. There might be better ways to debug this but this is what I did when I encountered errors. Hope it helps!

I think we can name the private boolean field as `isComplete` and the corresponding getter method as either `getComplete()` or `hasComplete()`. So it provides an alternative name for the getter method while still implying the same meaning and purpose.

Hi Maahir! You can simply rename the branch. The method is laid out [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch)

If you have not pushed the branch to your repo, then the following command would suffice `git branch -m &lt;oldname> &lt;newname>`

Hi! I searched up the web and found possible reasons why this could happen. 

If we type `git add *`, Git will add all files in the current directory to the staging area except for those that are listed in the `.gitignore` file or those that match the patterns defined in it. 

The .gitignore file may not be added to the staging area when you run `git add *` because of the following reasons:
- The `.gitignore`file is ignored by another `.gitignore` entry
- The `.gitignore` file is not in the directory where you're running `git add *`
- The `.gitignore` file was already added and committed previously

To explicitly add `.gitignore` file, we can run `git add .gitignore`. To add all modified files including `.gitignore` we can simply run `git add .`

Hope this helps!

Hi! 
The error message you are seeing indicates that there is a mismatch between the versions of the Java runtime you are using and the version of the JavaFX library in the project. It seems like you are using Java 8. To double check run `java --version` or you can go to `File -&gt; Project Structure` in IntelliJ and check that the SDK you are using is **Java 17**. If not, switch the SDK to Java 17. But if you are using Mac then specific **Azul JDK 17** distribution must be used, just having Java 17 would not suffice. You may follow [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html) to install the specific SDK. Once installed, you can go back to project structure and select `zulu-17` as your SDK instead.

Hope this helps!

Your app handles all the errors beautifully. It looks nice on my side also! I like how you tailor your app with a logo and a full-screen interface.

The C-Help extension is elegant and easy to understand. However, can try putting a link to the User Guide or providing more details on the `date` format. It is unclear at first, user can only know how to if they make at least 1 mistake.

In case you want to improve the error handling, you can consider unable the "Enter" and "Pressing Send button" actions when the TextField is empty!

Another thing, I don't know if it can be considered a bug based on the project requirement.

When I added a task, for example, a `todo` task by adding a few *spaces* after the command word `todo`, the current version still accepted it and did not consider it the wrong format. Same thing happened to `deadline` and `event` also.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50241632-a906-4df3-881e-630df4457a6c)

I solved this issue by following this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64059610/how-to-resolve-refusing-to-allow-an-oauth-app-to-create-or-update-workflow-on).

TLDR:
1. Creating a Personal Access Token in my Github account.
> Must store the PAT string somewhere as it will not be shown again once you leave the page.
2. Enable both repo and workflows in the PAT.
3. Removing all Github credentials (follow steps below the answer).
4. Login to SourceTree with PAT.
5. Push commit again.

Additionally, if you receive errors in your CI pipeline, you can check what went wrong under the `Actions` tab of your repo.

I had issues with CheckStyle and my JUnit tests, which caused my CI to fail.

Doesn't seem like your classes are put into a package so maybe try ```mainClass.set("JohnCena")``` in your build.gradle instead.

For my own bot, since my code are all in a ```lbot``` package, it is ```mainClass.set("lbot.Launcher")```.

Great tip! Another approach I found is to consider using the [try-with-resources statement](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html). This statement automatically manages the closing of resources, such as FileWriter and other types that implement `java.lang.AutoCloseable` or `java.io.Closeable`. 

By using try-with-resources, we can ensure that your file writers, scanners, and other resources are closed automatically at the end of the statement, even if an exception occurs. This can save time and prevent bugs related to resource management.

Here’s a quick example:
```java
try (FileWriter fileWriter = new FileWriter("output.txt")) ``{``
    // File Writing Logic Line 1
    // File Writing Logic Line 2
    // Code ...
    // File Writing Logic Line n
``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
    e.printStackTrace();
``}``
```

This way, there might not be a need to explicitly call fileWriter.close(), and it makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.

That is a checkstyle violation, not a build error. In Gradle, checkstyle violations are treated as errors during the build process, hence the error message. You can view the report indicated in the error message for more details about the violations in your code.

The reason for the missing components was mentioned in [AB3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/blob/4eb130f32ef1a3b492ce25c741fb06defd26fad4/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java#L8-L23):

```java
/**
 * The main entry point to the application.
 *
 * This is a workaround for the following error when MainApp is made the
 * entry point of the application:
 *
 *     Error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application
 *
 * The reason is that MainApp extends Application. In that case, the
 * LauncherHelper will check for the javafx.graphics module to be present
 * as a named module. We don't use JavaFX via the module system so it can't
 * find the javafx.graphics module, and so the launch is aborted.
 *
 * By having a separate main class (Main) that doesn't extend Application
 * to be the entry point of the application, we avoid this issue.
 */
```

There should already be a switch-docs-to-markbind branch in the repo so you just have to fetch it and merge it into master. Pushing the master branch up should run codecov assuming you have set it up correctly. Hope this helps!

Hi I also faced the same issue. The warning says that the URL is not registered. What you need to do is to go to `Settings` -&gt; `Languages & Frameworks` -&gt; `Schemas and DTDs`. Under the `Ignored schemas and DTDs` section click on `+` and then you copy and paste the URL inside. After that the warning would go off.

Thank you for the help, actually I found a fix but I'm not sure why it works. I placed my main class in one of my classes that i implemented. However, after moving my main class to the Launcher class as shown in tutorial, it runs. Why is this so ahah?

In this first Image, I had my main class in one of my chatbot classes. I thought I could initialise my chatbot that way but it resulted in the error shown above. 
In the second Image, I created the launcher class as show in tutorial 1 and my code could run. 
In the first part of the tutorial it is stated that the launcher class is used to work around a classpath issue but they didnt go into detail as to why. Could be something else though im not too sure myself

I was trying to get Gradle to work but am currently facing issues after deleting the .idea file. Was tinkering with the commands given in the 2103T website tutorial but cant seem to get it to work. Also accidentally invalidated caches in an attempt to fix the errors but inadvertently deleted my local history so I cannot rollback to a previous local version... Code cannot be compiled anymore and doing git pull on my previous work does not seem to make the code runnable. Any suggestions?

@damithc this is my current folder contents. My chatbot "Bonnie" cannot be run now after I tried getting gradle to work. I have in fact done `git clone` the repo into a new directory and this is what it looks like from my latest workable code. Any advice guys?

**4. :fas-info-circle: Git branching**
</div>

Hi all would appreciate any confirmation on my understanding on why things went wrong and suggestions on how I may attempt to fix this predicament.

I branched out to branch-level-7 at commit A.
But I realised I was still working on branch master, and I committed my changes - commit B on master.

Then I checkout to branch-level-7 and fetch the code from commit B on master, made further changes and commit C on branch-level-7. 

I merged back to master after commit C, I think it is because there is only one extra commit, git automatically did a ff merge for me so now branch-level-7 is technically the same as my master branch (same commits with same hashes, looks linear in GUI). Not sure if this understanding of the problem is accurate.

I think discussions can be left open until they are no longer relevant (for example, not much point in having a discussion about Level-2 work now). For `tips` I think we can close them after a few days - 1 week.

As for repeated questions, I think we can add a pinned comment/issue at the top (like the [AB3 crashes on Mac issue #146](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/146) that says something along the lines of "Have a question? Read this first" and then just describes how to search through the issues for a potential answer. Like how on other online forums (reddit, ed etc.) there is a ruleset pinned somewhere on the page that explains to people to first search to see if their question has already been answered before asking it. This could also work for multiple tips (either a separate pinned issue or inside the same issue).

@Arren11111 You might want to try printing the stack trace upon error using `e.printStackTrace()`. That might help you find the error.

Of the top of my head, it could be because you're missing this line in your `gradle.build` file:
```gradle
run ``{``
    standardInput = System.in
``}``
```
This makes sure that the standard input is set to the console when using `gradlew run`

Edit: Seems like you do have it. I downloaded your code and it seems to work fine. Is the issue resolved?

I think you could use `getIsComplete()` instead. Shows both things: that its a getter method, and that its gets the `isComplete` value.

Is it directly using the `docs/README.md` file from your repository? If it isn't, you may have typo-ed something. From the screenshot you shared, it seems like the table is entirely missing and there is just a closing `</table>` tag. That might be causing parsing issues and may be the reason your markdown is not being rendered.

<img width="806" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-17 at 08 09 10" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7b245e8-71cc-4344-bdc2-b9b82c9c1d65">

If that still doesn't work, try to use pipe characters for your table instead of using the `<table>` tags. [Here is how this works](https://diplodoc.com/docs/en/syntax/tables/gfm).

Basically just try to look for some inconsistency - unpaired brackets/backticks/tags, extra space etc.

Unfortunately I'm not too sure why tasklists and alerts are not being processed since both kramdown and GFM support them (and with the same syntax, as far as I can tell). I'll keep looking, but if anyone else has figured out the solution feel free to jump in.

I was working on the next iteration of the tp and sent a PR only for it to fail Codecov's test coverage. After looking at the areas where coverage is supposed to be missing, I found that majority of the missing coverage was in the UI components I have added to the project. I presumed that UI components were not required to be tested as the tp's original code had no tests for the UI components, but I might have to to pass Codecov's check. Is there any way to write tests for these components?

Hi @yizhong187, 

I have tested your application on windows and it runs. Here is a screenshot of how it's looking on my PC.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d2ca415-5ed4-4d8c-8594-60ba63b1c20d)
However, I also encountered the bug @Chronoxy found, in which I could not mark or unmark the task that was third in the list. In my case, the task was a todo, so I think it might be something to do with mark/unmark and the tasklist. I tried to delete the third task and it worked.

> In CS2030 (the version taught by Prof Henry Chia) he advocates for all objects to be made immutable. For eg. if you want to change a `Task` object from being not-done to done, you should return a `new Task` rather than by modifying the boolean attribute tracking the "doneness" of the task. This makes the coding "safer" as there's no risk of accidentally changing the state / value of objects during runtime, but also makes it harder to program as the object changes after each state change (and the new object needs to slot into the place of the old one).

Prof Chia himself says that the extremely strict immutability is only a requirement for teaching purposes, and that in many real-life scenarios complete and absolute immutability is unergonomic, unperformant and possibly even unattainable at the systems level.

Hi all 😄, I moved task creation logic from the task classes (Todo, Deadline, Event) to dedicated factory classes to reduce complexity.

Ah, I initially took a similar approach, validating both user inputs and file inputs directly within the task subclasses. However, I found that this caused the subclasses to become quite lengthy, as I was checking and parsing both file and user input within each class. In my case, I didn't have a shared parser method across all subclasses—each class had its own method for validation and parsing, which might have been the core issue. Did you encounter something similar? How did you handle it and overcome this problem?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Merge Conflict Issue**

While I was trying to merge a branch into my master branch, there were some merge conflicts and I managed to deconflict them. However, now I have some random files that are not commited yet, as per the screenshot.

I have checked my remote repo and the Ui class is correct in the master branch. However, in my local repo, it still contains 2 copies of the Ui class. Do I just delete the excess files and the old Ui class?

Alternatively, since the remote repo is correct, is it safe for me to just re-clone the remote repo again and delete these files?

**1. :fas-info-circle: Use of assert statements**

Hi since assert statements are meant for testing important assumptions that should already hold (potential errors should already be handled such that the assumptions should hold) should we catch it if it's actually thrown. Or should our program function 100% correctly such that at all times it shouldn't be thrown at all because all assumptions should already hold, and that assert statements are simply just there for the last protective measure ?

With regards to the text-Ui-testing, since we're required to do level-7 which is to save the tasks into a script, then what's the use of running the runtest.bat and checking if ACTUAL.TXT == EXPECTED.TXT.  Since, EXPECTED.TXT will always change as we add more tasks to the list and the script .txt file will always get updated with more new tasks, then we will always have to manually change the EXPECTED.TXT each time, because the output system.out will always change.

or are assert statements mainly to serve as a form of documentation that clearly states the assumptions or constraints of the code at a specific point for easier debugging in future maybe, or for others to understand ur code better.
Since if perhaps errors/exceptions are potentially alr accounted for/handled, what's the use of assert statements

Hi, I am a mac user and the bitbot.jar file runs properly on my mac! Good job on your iP, maybe you could pass you instructions message as a separate text instead of stating everything at in your introduction text. You could also see if you can add a condition in your list printing method to print that there's no tasks in the list when 0 tasks as now it prints an empty list.

For pushing changes from the local branch to the corresponding remote branch, the website used this command

But, when I tried using this command while being in the add-intro branch, it worked as well

`$ git push`

If you do the second way while being in the branch whose changes you want to push, does it by default push to the origin and that's why we don't have to specify which remote repo we are pushing it to? So unless we have other remote repos we want to push to, can we just use the shortcut of git push? Is it also the same for git pull as well?

**2. :fas-info-circle: Should tags accumulate over time?**
</div>


Hey alls,

I have noticed that in my process of tagging, my older commits are getting many, many tags:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c861b80-3f12-4118-a227-b799138117f2)
Most recent commit

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a7d7bc5-dd12-45ae-be93-c2b4c58e8c36)
Level 3 commit - but the subsequent tags are also present =O

I am asking around if anyone has also noticed this in their ip. In case it is relevant, I am using the GUI provided by IntelliJ and adding my tags from there. If so, do you think this is a desirable or expected use of tags?

Hi Prof and all, thanks for your inputs! I have switched over and tried the tagging using just the CLI - the same thing occurs. I have verified that my tags are stationary as they should be.

It seems that this is some quirk of GitHub, which displays all tags that are downstream from that release. Here are other people in the wild facing this quirk as well:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50542908/git-tag-tags-all-the-previous-commits-as-well
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59308676/multiple-git-tags-appear-in-software-release-on-github

But I wonder why this is something that github has?

Tested on mac.

2 main bugs:
Commands that start with a trailing space arent handled as errors (Currently, error message only works if first character is a letter)

I think the text storage mechanism to make storage persistent may not be working as well.

Please do come and try my release [here](https://github.com/josh1248/ip/releases/tag/BCD-Extension]) . It has default commands (no user guide yet 😅)

I think this is referring to the requirement for the subject of the latest 5 commits of your ip to follow the standard given in the textbook, which are 1) Use imperative mood, 2) Capitalise first letter, 3) Don't end subject line with a period. If your recent commits don't follow these guidelines, maybe you could add minor edits and commit them with appropriate commit messages. I also don't think you need the full commit messages for this git standard label to turn green.

Firstly, thanks for the replies!

>Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.
I didn't copy and paste and instead it just auto-filled it, so I'm unsure why it still didn't record. 

@damithc I see, but I am still unsure as to why it didn't record in the dashboard since the updated Readme shows on my iP too, despite my commits. Becayse I seem to be meeting all the requirements listed (unless it has something to do with the emoji format). Could it perhaps be something to do with the progress tracker?😕

#### Cause
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67854139/javafx-warning-unsupported-javafx-configuration-classes-were-loaded-from-unna  
This may be related to the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) introduced in Java 9. And the JavaFX only supports being loaded from the module-path, not the class-path.

```java
LocalDate d4 = LocalDate.now();
System.out.println(d4.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MMM d yyyy")));
```

The issue is caused by the fact that default locale of my laptop is not English. If anyone is facing the same issue, adding an the `.withLocale` method to the end of `ofPattern` will solve the issue.

```java
LocalDate d4 = LocalDate.now();
System.out.println(d4.format(DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("MMM d yyyy").withlocale(Locale.ENGLISH)));

Hello! I am using Windows and it is working fine! However, I do have some comments that you could take a look at as well:

- According to the GUI, the date must be keyed in `yyyy-dd-MM` for creating new events. However, when I did so, I got this error in my terminal saying that the range of 20 is out of bounds from 1-12. It likely means that the input format is `yyyy-MM-dd` instead. Do take a look at the screenshot attached below!
- There are a few formatting errors as well as shown in the second screenshot below.

Hi, I believe I managed to fix the issue. Those who are still interested to help test may try [here](https://github.com/natlv/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).

It seemed the original problem was with javafx.application.Application being in the original Launcher class. After refactoring my Launcher class to not include Application and then rebuilding with `./gradlew clean shadowjar`, the problem appears to have been resolved.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Unable to resolve javafx in fxml file**
</div>

# Context
Hi! I'm currently on the last step of the JavaFX tutorial. However, for some reason my fxml files have multiple errors as my javafx and related classes are unable to be resolved. (I'm using Intellij on Windows btw)

More specifically, the below import statements are unable to be resolved:

```fxml
<?import javafx.scene.layout.AnchorPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.TextField?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.Button?>
<?import javafx.scene.control.ScrollPane?>
<?import javafx.scene.layout.VBox?>
```

This is a screengrab of the error messages:
<img width="252" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9b40fb7-1458-4903-a40f-a2f42e845b7e">


# Steps taken (that did not work)

I have followed the other parts of the tutorial exactly up to this point. I have searched how to resolve this on the web and done the below to try to resolve it (but it still showed the same issues):

- Ensuring that I am using the correct JDK/SDK
- Clearing Intellij cache
- Ensuring that my file directory structures are correctly set up
- Ensuring that my files are marked correctly (eg. marking resources folder as a resources folder)
<img width="217" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e99a8733-c4da-4fc3-ace6-4788b29c1d8d">

- Ensuring that `fx:controller` correctly points to duke.MainWindow (as I placed it in a package)
- Ensuring that javafx plugin is enabled in Intellij

I have also tried editing the build.gradle file, but to no avail:

Hi @QinHaichen12 

Thanks for commenting! No, those are not all the errors. Here is the full list:

_NOTE: Ignore the fact that the last error says "MainWindow" instead of "duke.MainWindow", I've shifted around some files on my local repo since the time I've posted this (It previously said "duke.MainWindow" when I posted this query because everything was packaged within duke). 

Previously, changing "duke.MainWindow" to anything else (eg. "MainWindow") leads to more errors. So I suspect the problem lies with javafx and not so much the file structure, but I may be wrong._

Okay I have resolved the issue and I'm putting it here in case anyone needs it. 

1. Ensure that the "resources" file is marked as a source file and not a resource file. You can do this by checking that the file icon next to the word resources looks like this:
<img width="92" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1081bdf-ddaf-4bab-a9d4-d234daee488c">

(Initially mine had a yellow logo instead)

2. Not sure if this affects anything, but I also ensured that the Main, MainWindow, DialogBox and Launcher classes were outside my `duke` package

3. If you're using Intellij, right click on the import statements and select "Show Context Actions". There should be a list of actions that appears (mainly adding different modules and dependencies). I just clicked on each one until the error messages all went away.

Thanks @damithc , @k-hian and @QinHaichen12 for help on this!

Hello, I'm currently working on W3.1b RCS: Branching. In the course instructions (step 9), the branch graphic shown is as shown below:

**1. :fas-info-circle: Naming Booleans and their Getter Methods**
</div>

### Problem
When a class contains a private Boolean field (e.g. `isComplete`) and said Boolean is exposed via a getter method, it is intuitive to name the getter method as `isComplete()`. However, this would lead to a duplicate in naming as `isComplete` is already used to name the variable.

In this case, what would be a better way to name the Boolean variable and its corresponding getter method?

### Attempts at Resolution
1. My current implementation would name the Boolean field as `complete`, and its getter method would be named `isComplete()`.

2. However, it can be argued that naming both the Boolean field and the getter method `isComplete` and `isComplete()` respectively is also fine.
This is because accessing the variable directly and calling the getter method are syntactically different (one uses brackets, the other does not).
In addition, only `isComplete()` can be called from outside the class—assuming the appropriate data-hiding precautions are taken.

3. Another possible option could be to name it `isComplete` and to name its getter as `isIsComplete()`, but this sounds slightly silly to me. 

### Following Conventions
The [coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/java/#naming) used in this course recommends that Boolean variables/methods should be named to sound like Booleans but makes no mention of cases like these. The [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) provided also does not address this issue. 

### External Sources
Google searches have yielded me some of these discussions on Stack Overflow:
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5322648/for-a-boolean-field-what-is-the-naming-convention-for-its-getter-setter
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4851337/setter-for-a-boolean-variable-named-like-isactive
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49273722/what-should-be-the-name-of-getter-method-for-a-boolean-variable-starting-with-i

These posts mostly have answers that recommend solution 1, but seems to be based on the [JavaBeans Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans#Code_example) (see Boolean property `deceased`). Hence, it might not be applicable to the conventions used in this course.

### Help Needed
Has anyone encountered this issue with naming while working on their iP? If so, how did you to resolve it? Thanks in advance. :)

Thanks for your responses over the past few days. It has been helpful to see the different approaches taken to tackle this issue.

### Context
As requested by @tckeong, this question stems from the implementation of `Task` class in the iP, where a Boolean variable is required to keep track of its completion status.
```
public class Task ``{``
    private boolean isComplete; // the boolean of interest
    
    // a setter method which is used
    public void setComplete(boolean isComplete) ``{``
        this.isComplete = isComplete;
    ``}``

    // other methods that are not relevant
```
However, there has been no real need for a getter method to check for the Boolean `isComplete` in the iP. Hence, this question is **purely hypothetical** and has no real implications for the actual `Task` class.

### Suggestions
The suggestions provided have their own merit, but I cannot fully agree with some of them as the intent of the method would change with the change in naming.

> `getComplete()` and `getIsComplete()`.
- `getComplete()` and `getIsComplete()` follow the standard convention for getter methods but fails to comply with the coding standard where Boolean variables/methods should be named to sound like Booleans. These names do not immediately suggest that the method will return a Boolean value and could be possibly misinterpreted.

> `checkIsComplete()` indicates that the method checks if the task is complete.
- The method never checks if the task is complete—it only returns the Boolean variable. This could lead to a misinterpretation of the method's intent as well.

> `hasComplete()` provides an alternative name for the getter method.
- `hasComplete()` follows the convention for naming Boolean methods, but the word 'has' wouldn't sound like proper English when used in conditional statements, i.e. `if(task.hasComplete())`.
- Providing an alternative name also doesn't seem like good practice, since having multiple words that mean the same thing can confuse other readers (and yourself) as the codebase grows larger.
For example, `evaluate`, `calculate`, `determine` and `compile` are all verbs that could be used interchangeably and mean the same thing unless otherwise specified. `fetch`, `retrieve` and `get` is another good example.
- This inconsistent use of verbs would make it hard to keep track what concept/action each verb maps to.
As such, I can't fully agree with this approach either.

### Down to Preference
As it stands, I would still prefer my (and @psh12320's) approach of treating the private field as a flag `complete` and the getter method with the Boolean-sounding name of `isComplete()`, though this would be a biased opinion.

I believe that this is incredibly subjective and ultimately boils down to personal preference. At the end of the day, being consistent within the codebase would be the most important.

Will leave this issue as open for a few more days in case of more discussion, but will close it if there are no responses after this point. Thanks again for taking the time to chime in on this!

Your error might be related to the application failing to find the image files specified to be displayed. Perhaps your image files got renamed or moved to a new location?

This is my current implementation for loading the image files into the `Image` object.
```
private final Image botImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/lawrence.jpg"));
```
If I rename the image file's address to:
```
// changed to a .png file
private final Image botImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/lawrence.png"));
```

I encounter the same error as you as `lawrence.png` does not exist.
```
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Input stream must not be null
        at javafx.scene.image.Image.validateInputStream(Image.java:1137)
        at javafx.scene.image.Image.<init>(Image.java:704)
        at lawrence.ui.components.MainWindow.<init>(MainWindow.java:29)
        ... 23 more
```
However, it should be noted that I am unable to run `gradlew run` successfully when I encounter this error. If your image files were specified correctly, your issue is likely to stem from something else.

@TohLiYuan @neyapraveen Thank you for the help and it has solved my issues! 

I tried option 2 too, which is unchecking "Caught Exceptions", but that didn't stop IntelliJ from breaking at handled exceptions. I will move on with option 1 and always switch back to the main terminal.

                    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``; // how should this closing curly brace be indented?
```

or 

```java
TaskType taskType = 
    switch (data.charAt(0)) ``{``
    case 'T' -&gt; TaskType.TODO;
    case 'E' -&gt; TaskType.EVENT;
    case 'D' -&gt; TaskType.DEADLINE;
    default -&gt; TaskType.UNKNOWN;
``}``;

@zaidansani 

I think your indentation example makes a lot of sense, and I think any regular JS/TS/React users (including myself) would  appreciate the familiarity of the indentation style (it looks just like any other arrow function). So I agree with your idea on this one. 

I would recommend anyone pondering about this issue to stay away from the first example that I showed. As Zaidan mentioned, if the variable name we are assigning to is very long, the case statements that have to align to the start of the switch statement will have a lot of leading whitespace, which I find only adds more mental load to the reader.

Furthermore, it would mean that different switch expressions would have different levels of indentation for their case statements, since the start of the switch statement depends on the length of the variable we're assigning to. It would be very difficult to align the case statement indentation across multiple switch expressions, let alone just two.

On a related note, do the grading scripts only detect PRs merged into `master`? If we make PRs to features that are still in development on a separate branch from master, will they still count towards the weekly requirement?

I was trying to understand the differences in exception handling offered by `java.nio.file` vs `java.io.File` and would like to know which package is more recommended.

It seems that the exceptions in `java.nio.file` are more specific than in `java.io.File`. For example, when `duke.txt` is not found, the former would throw a `NoSuchFileException` compared to the latter which would throw an `IOException`.

Is there any recommendation or are we free to experiment and change along the way?

Here are the steps I took to resolve this error:

1. Copy-paste the links on the internet. 

2. Once done, the files `configuration_1_3.dtd` and `suppressions_1_2.dtd` will be downloaded. 

3. You can paste those files within the same `config/checkstyle` folder as `checkstyle.xml` and `suppressions.xml`.

4. After doing the above, you can write the following code instead:

``` xml
<!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC
        "-//Checkstyle//DTD Checkstyle Configuration 1.3//EN"
        "configuration_1_3.dtd">

```

The same can be done for `suppressions.xml`.

There will be no longer be any URI not registered error.

I believe solution 1 is the cleanest and most 'intuitive' approach. 

By naming the boolean field `complete` and its getter method as `isComplete()`, we maintain clarity and adhere to the coding standard of having method names that represent an action. Additionally, the field name remains easy to understand and intuitive for developers even though it doesn't contain a prefix. 

Other solutions such as using `getIsComplete()` as a getter method name is rather verbose for something seemingly simple and may not easy for developers to grasp. 

I think that solution 1 is balanced in terms of being readable and complying with coding standards.

Then again, in CS2103T, we should be following the coding standards given here regardless. 
Rationale: Just follow it 😝

Yes. When you run git push while on a branch without specifying the remote (like origin) or the branch name, Git will automatically push to the branch's corresponding remote branch. This works because Git keeps track of the relationship between your local branch and its upstream counterpart on the remote. Typically, when you create a new branch off of a remote branch or when you clone a repository, Git will set up this tracking relationship for you. So, as long as your branch is tracking the correct remote branch, you can simply use git push without any extra arguments, and it will push to the appropriate remote branch by default.

Hey @jevan13, it could also be worth checking your Git settings for line ending conversions, like core.autocrlf. Sometimes Git modifies line endings based on your OS, which might explain why it looks fine in IntelliJ but not on GitHub.

hi everyone, im having trouble with level 7, more specifically "Load the data from the hard disk when the chatbot starts up." because whatever i write to the file doesn't persist when i run the program again. i'm using java.io.FileWriter to read and write to files:

 ```
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("data/sigma.txt");
        try ``{``
            File file = new File("data/sigma.txt");
            if (file.createNewFile()) ``{``
                System.out.println("New file created: " + file.getName());
            ``}`` else ``{``
                System.out.println("File already exists.");
                // open the file
                for (String line: Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("data/sigma.txt"))) ``{``
                    System.out.println(line + "\n");
                ``}``
            ``}``
        ``}`` catch (IOException e) ``{``
            System.out.println("error occurred creating file");
        ``}``

// handle todo task
// ...
 items.add(task);
 try ``{``
    writer.write(task + "\n");
    writer.flush(); 
``}`` catch (IOException exception) ``{``
     System.err.println("an error occurred writing to file" + exception.getMessage());
``}``

// close program
            if (userInput.contains("bye")) ``{``
                System.out.println("bye");
                writer.flush();
                writer.close();
                break;
            ``}``
```

it always prints out "File already exists" but the file will be empty on every run. anyone has any luck trying to get the contents to persist? or should i use a different class to write to files

sorry for terrible formatting

I used AI tools to aid me in autocompleting repetitive methods, some of those which looked very similar to other methods I written. This helped me to save a great deal of time in rewriting those code

I also attempted to use AI to refactor some of the code so it is more readable and neater, so as to utilise as much SLAP as possible

For negatives, AI does generate wrong code and you have to spend time to undo the changes that may not be beneficial. This may result in more time than usual if there is over reliance. Hence, I wrote most of the code before using AI as a tool to support my learning!

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Failing automated testing because of trailing whitespaces. (MacOS)**
</div>

When comparing ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT I realised I was failing the test because my ACTUAL.TXT file had whitespaces at the end of some lines specifically at lines where the script writes inputs. 

To fix this I added the following lines of code in the `runtest.sh` file after both text files were converted to UNIX:
```
# trim trailing whitespace
sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]*$//' ACTUAL.TXT
sed -i '' 's/[[:space:]]*$//' EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT
```
These commands search for any whitespaces at the end of both text files and removes them. 

I'm not sure how to do the same on Windows or if this is common practise at all so maybe someone else can chime in below.

I just copy pasted the Actual.txt file into the Expected.txt file from my clipboard the first time I ran the script like the tutorial suggested. Maybe the issue inherently is with the way I print my particular strings because when I copied it over, some of the white spaces did not transfer over properly and even when I manually edited them in, after saving the file, they would just disappear. 

What would then be a better practise in the future for this particular case?

From my understanding, it seems that the above is intentional due to the 8 spaces required for wrapped lines: 

> Indentation for wrapped lines should be 8 spaces (i.e. twice the normal indentation of 4 spaces) more than the parent line.

However, I do agree that in the case of method chaining, it does look cleaner if the methods were aligned. I don't know if we're allowed to make suggestions to the coding style, though.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Are we supposed to fork the original tp repo, or the newly created team tp repo?**
</div>

Hi, I am a bit confused here.
The tp task for week 6 says that:
```
Fork the tp repo to your personal GitHub account.
```

I forked the **team tp repo** but the dashboard failed to detect it. So I am wondering if there is a misunderstanding here. Is it actually referring to the **original tp repo**  or **team tp repo**? Thanks!

Hi, do objects have to be immutable?

In CS2030, we have to make every object immutable, and every attribute needs to be declared as "final." Is that the case in this course too?

Hi, 2 possibly minor issues were found.
Firstly, doing archive with extra text works instead of notifying the user of an errant command. If this is a feature, then feel free to ignore it:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdaa46ff-c51f-4ee5-becc-2f684b5e95d4)

Secondly, when I archive my task list, proceed to add further tasks and archive again, it overwrites the previously archived tasks. 2 ways to fix this would be to either changing from writing to appending when you save to archive.txt, or a while loop to increment the archive(n).txt for each new archived file.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ace20796-a5bd-41ea-af46-d3e455295fb7)

Cheers!

> The reason this happens is because you keep creating a new instance of the scanner every time the loop repeats.

Hi, I also encountered a similar issue. However, my test cases were not able to be run even through the terminal. I fixed it by using gradle to clean the previous build, and building it again.

As stated by the error, I believe gradle was unable to find the test cases. When I only ran the specific test case, ToDoTest in this case, which is under the Tasks package, the following error pops up.
```
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> No tests found for given includes: [tasks.ToDoTest](--tests filter)

* Try:
> Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace.
> Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
> Run with --scan to get full insights.
```
I then ran it using the following gradle test command
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a025bd5-0fca-49c4-8836-ac3af6ed8b89)

This gave me the following error:
```
> Task :compileJava UP-TO-DATE
> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :classes UP-TO-DATE
> Task :compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE

BUILD FAILED in 733ms
3 actionable tasks: 1 executed, 2 up-to-date
```

Opening the report allowed me to see this page, which I then clicked on the failed test.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131ec10a-1831-4841-a652-b5fb76de6f24)

One of the lines informed me that gradle was expecting my test to be under the "Tasks" folder instead of "tasks" folder.
```
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: tasks/ToDoTest (wrong name: Tasks/ToDoTest)
```
This was likely because I renamed my "Tasks" package to "tasks" instead to follow package name conventions. Having already built the project before this change, I am guessing that gradle was expecting a different name based on the built project, which led to the error.

If rebuilding your project doesn't fix your error, maybe your report may tell you more to help fix it.

I see that some of your commit messages do not follow what’s in the guide, so I presume that’s not the problem. Rather I infer that the problem lies in the structure of the branch. Perhaps you could try using Sourcetree to visualise the structure and confirm that this is just how the branch structure looks like in your repository? Alternatively, a third option, you can also visualise the git branches on the CLI via `git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph`. I hope this helps!

**1. :fas-info-circle: iP tag and commit enquiries**
</div>



It's stated "git tag the commit with the exact increment ID e.g., Level-2, A-TextUiTesting" in the CS2103/T site but I have 2 questions about this. 

1.) Is omitting the spaces alright as it seems Sourcetree doesn't allow for spaces in tag name? 
2.) When I try to assign 2 commits to a tag of similar name, Sourcetree seems to not permit this (prompts me to transfer the tag to the other commit). What if I have several commits which relate to the same incrementID/stage? E.g. Level-0.Rename,Greet,Exit -&gt; Would Level-**0.1**.Rename,Greet,Exit suffice if there was a 2nd commit working on this same stage?

Thank you in advance for the help

@somethingfishyfishy I could be wrong but my understanding of enums is that while they are used for discrete and finite values, the range should be relatively small(e.g. days of the week) as well else one has to define an enumerated name for every integer(0-10000) which isn't very practical.

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡Duke A-TextUiTesting: cmd window closing too fast, and my solution**
</div>

Hello friends, just wanting to share an experience in doing Week 2's project tasks.

I found that the cmd window opened and closed too fast for me to see the result of the comparison in the .bat file, and I learnt that adding 'pause' at the end of the .bat file keeps the cmd window open for you. Just throwing this out for everyone else on Windows, so you don't have to check both EXPECTED.TXT and ACTUAL.TXT manually.

1. You can right click the commit you reverted (with the commit details Revert "A-TextUiTesting & Removed Indentations") 
2. **Click on the same option "Reverse commit..."**. 
3. You will be able to get back to the original state right before you clicked the reverse commit button. 
4. The commit details should show: Revert "Revert "A-TextUiTesting & Removed Indentations""

Agreeing with the points above, it would be good practice to include the default case to handle values (e.g by throwing an exception) that are not explicitly handled by the cases. The example in the Java documentation includes the default case as well: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/switch.html

Hello, I ran your jar file on my mac and everything looks good, just have a few comments:

-  Maybe could have a more useful message when the list is empty so that it doesn't seem like the app is malfunctioning?
- I think your current code dumps the whole data file when 1 input is faulty instead of just discarding that particular data input, not sure if its your intended behaviour
- Can consider trimming whitespaces from inputs also so that people cannot insert empty descriptions for the tasks
- Maybe can make find non caps-sensitive so that "read" and "Read" are basically the same word 

Other that that, I think its great!

**2. :fas-info-circle: Font and font size causing ellipses to appear instead.**
</div>

While playing around with JavaFX, I wanted to change the font and font size of my label in my DialogBox.

```
<Label fx:id="dialog" text="Label" wrapText="true" minHeight="-Infinity">
            <padding>
                <Insets top="0" right="10" bottom="0" left="10"/>
            </padding>
            <style>
                -fx-font-family: Arial;
                -fx-font-size: 10pt;
            </style>
</Label>
```

however, when I did this, I noticed that now, whenever I have a label that ends with a new line ("\n"), it turns the last line into an ellipses.

for example, given a response of:
```
"1.[T][X] read book\n" +
"2.[D][ ] return book (by: June 6th)\n" +
"3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Aug 6th 2pm to: 4pm)\n" +
"4.[T][X] join sports club\n" +
"5.[T][ ] borrow book\n"
```

it would show:
1.[T][X] read book
2.[D][ ] return book (by: June 6th)
3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Aug 6th 2pm to: 4pm)
4.[T][X] join sports club
...

I thought that by having wrapText="true" and minHeight="-Infinity", it would prevent ellipses from happening. Does anyone know why this is happening?

**3. :fas-info-circle: Packages and their uses**
</div>

My understanding is that you should create packages for _types_ that are related to each other.
In my iP, i have an abstract class, and 3 classes that extend this abstract class. I believe this classifies as being related, and would like to bundle them together in the same class. However, following the convention that files in the same package have to be of the same type, does this approach break that rule?
I also have 2 exceptions, and would like to bundle them together in an "exceptions" package.

Is this the right way to handle how I think about packages? 

also, does every file need to be in a package? what about my main executable (e.g Duke) ? when I tried to put that into a "main" package, i got the following error:
"Class DGPT, referenced in file EXPECTED.TXT, will not be accessible from module ip  
Class DGPT, referenced in file README.md, will not be accessible from module ip  
Class DGPT, referenced in file runtest.bat, will not be accessible from module ip"

is the error coming from the fact that my file's directory has now changed, and my files have to adjust accordingly?

Hi, I assume when you mean committing 2 files at once, you mean adding 2 files to a commit.

I'm not sure what's the guidelines or recommendations are for this course, so hope someone could fill me in on this as well. Personally, I would complete all my work for each Level before adding/staging them all into one commit with a general description of what I have done for the commit (like a major revision/change). After staging them, I would add the tag for the level and push them all to my forked repo. Would probably be easier for you to view the key changes you have made for each level increment in a single commit and leaving minor bug fixes as extra commits thereafter.

Hi. I did not use any IDEs for git, utilised terminal to commit and tag my commits manually with `git tag Level-6` and so on, I see similar tags on my older commits on Github as well. My interpretation is that Github shows the tag on the current commit as well as subsequent/child tags as I have checked using `gitk` that I'm not tagging on multiple commits. I have also verified using `git show` and `git checkout` to check out different tags and showing the commit info. This is what I got:

Hi, I had a similar issue whereby my application was running in the IDE but the jar was not. It turned out that there was a capital letter causing in my path name causing it to be incorrect. So maybe just make sure all your file paths are exactly word for word correct. If I'm not wrong the ...20 more at the end of the error message in the terminal might help you out and tell you exactly where the error is. So you could try directing the error message into a text file and see if it gives you more details.

**1. :fas-info-circle: How to create stubs for testing**
</div>

According to the notes, a stub have is supposed to implement the interface of the class which it is replacing.

<img width="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae404c06-ebf1-42b1-80ad-182a4a6bf8b7">

I have a function in my `Command` class that has the following function prototype `Response execute(TaskList tasks, Ui ui, Storage storage)` which I want to perform J-Unit test on to ensure it returns the right Response.

My understanding is that I am supposed to create a stub for `TaskList`, `Ui`, and `Storage`. However, none of these classes implements any interface. Nonetheless, within these classes, it still needs to have all the public methods found in their class right (regardless if it will be used or not). These methods will be a simple implementation such as returning null. 

May I check if my understanding for the J-Unit testing with stubs correct? Else, how would you test the function as stated above? Thank you!

Platform.exit();
```

My question is where do you call it? In _MainWindow#handleUserInput_, or do you have a `public void handleExit() ``{`` Platform.exit(); ``}``` method in the _Main_ class which is passed into the _MainWindow_ class and called as a callback function?

Or is there a cleaner way to exit the application which I am missing? Please share your ways! Thank you! 😀

**3. :fas-info-circle: 💡Auto Formatting with IDEA**
</div>

For those struggling with styling of your code, you can use IDEA's auto formatter.

The formatting shortcuts in Intellij IDEA are :
For Windows : Ctrl + Alt + L
For Ubuntu : Ctrl + Alt + Windows + L
For Mac : ⌥ (Option) + ⌘ (Command) + L

You can change the default style configurations using File > Setting > Editor > Code Style.
For instance, to change IDEA auto formatter such that the indentation for `switch` and `case` is aligned, you can specify it here:
<img width="728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20383cf7-1629-42cc-84da-892ebfd83de5">

Do note that while you can use the auto formatters to automate certain aspects of the code style, you still need be familiar with coding standards because other aspects such as naming convention cannot be automated.

Hi @blackpanther9229 , can I ask how you set up the Intellij to recognise the external URL? I tried adding External DTD URLs in my **IntelliJ File → Settings→ Languages & Frameworks → Schemas and DTDs**, but I was still facing the same error when running`./gradlew checkstyleMain checkstyleTest`

Morning prof @damithc ! I have asked TEAMMATES to resend my submission link, but the resent link seems to be related to Product Concept rather than Peer Evaluation.
<img width="752" alt="031410772094e2ef0c0d4260fa5daeb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e26626a-0e75-4e1d-abb1-2cafd457b2d6">
Is there an alternative way to get the submission link for Peer Evaluation from TEAMMATES?

Building on what RezwanAhmed123 said, going off what is available in the course materials magic numbers should be fine if it is clear what the magic number represents. At the same time, I'll wager its probably best not to use it as far as possible given that the naming convention at the [Week 4 topics page](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week4/topics.html#w4-6-code-quality-naming) specify that names like label1 label2 are already frowned upon.

Not exactly sure if this is good, but what I essentially did was inject the stage into the `MainWindow` like how the Duke equivalent was injected into it with *MainWindow#setDuke*, then had *MainWindow#handleUserInput* detect when the user input was "bye" ( or when Duke / your equivalent responded with the bye message) and invoke the *Stage::close* function of the injected stage. 

This seemed to work as typing "bye" would close the window. The handleExit method sounds neater though!

As I understand from your user guide, 'archive' command will only archive completed task (which I interpret as "marked" task), however when I type archive, all tasks are gone regardless of their marking status

Would you mind to explain a little bit more about this function? Maybe I understand it wrong HAHAHA.

I think it's because your current branch is set to track origin/main, but origin/main has been removed or is no longer available on the remote.
Hence, if you would like to reset the tracking, git is suggesting you to 'git branch --unset-upstream'.

One hint is to check the branches that exist on the remote first:
'
git branch -r
'

For example in the image above for Level-2, any text the user has entered will be added to a list, besides the 2 keywords **bye** and **list**.

Are we allowed to change it such that the user has to type in **add &lt;Item name>** for it to be added into the list, since the functionality is the same but the method of adding is different.

@jevan13  Is this your second time running the tests? If I am right gradle caches the build if you have passed the test successfully once, which would show it as skipped in IntelliJ.

You can use the cli gradlew to force the test, see whether it works:
`./gradlew test --rerun-tasks` 

alternatively modify some bits of your code and rerun the test in IntelliJ

I would like to share my thoughts as well. My opinion is to make things that are supposed to _always_ be immutable, immutable and things that are not immutable not immutable. Things should not be immutable by default unless enforced by the programming language (e.g. you are using a functional programming language).

When you create a class that is final, it should be a _final_ commitment. Every other piece of code that will interact with your class will try to make a copy just to make modifications. Some pieces of concurrent code may also assume that it will never change and treat it as safe for [repeatable reads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93write_conflict).

When a new requirement comes and forces us to change our class to not be final, then we are breaking all these assumptions we initially had. We may have to analyse every usage, which is very time consuming.

That being said:
- The stakes are much lower for `private` and unexposed (i.e. no getters) fields since it is only visible to the current class. So don't worry so much about it
- I don't see much difference in making a class `final`...but these people seem to have quite a bit to say: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218744/good-reasons-to-prohibit-inheritance-in-java

---

On a separate note,

> I think for the future when we add more stuff to the code, if we make it immutable its gonna take a really long time to load it. So I personally jsut did a mutable one

There is a way to make immutable objects "faster" but at the cost of code complexity (since Java does not support it natively). Can take a look at [persistent data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_data_structure). Clojure is an example of a language that supports it natively.

I think that enums offer two main possible benefits:
1. Slight speed increase (as we will learn/have learned in CS2100)
2. Type checking for constants

I agree with @cth06-Github that currently there is no need to use enums for the commands. Currently, there is only one usage of such an enum. For example, if we had an enum like WinstonJin has mentioned:

```java
enum Commands ``{``
    TODO("todo"),
    DEADLINE("deadline"),
    // ...
``}``
```

The rest of our codebase will only use this enum once: when we are parsing the first word from the user's input and checking what to do:
```java
switch (Commands.valueOf(input)) ``{``
    case Commands.TODO:
        // run todo
        break;
    // ...
``}``
```

Since it is only used once, there is no point in separating it into another enum. We should make an enum only if there is somewhere else in our code where we need to use the `Commands` enum. This way, we can leverage on the type checking the compiler does to ensure both values are the same.

Great job in designing the GUI, with circular pictures of the faces. For duplicate detection, I would like to ask if its the intended feature to detect duplicates across tasks (for example, a todo and event with the same description is considered a duplicate). I thought the duplicate detection applied for duplicates within the same category of tasks (e.g. 2 todos with the same description is not allowed but a todo and an event with the same description is allowed as its under different categories)

Which branch was the deleted commit on? Was the commit pushed before you deleted it? If it was, then there's a chance you could retrieve it. I'm trying to see from your repo but I'm not sure haha.... 

If the commits were local and not pushed, I believe there is a chance that your IDE might have shelved them...

@RezwanAhmed123 I think your approach generally makes sense but in my opinion your UI class should still include your text input. This is because UI involves both input and output from/to users. 

Likewise, I used enums and allowed the Command class to have an `execute` method

@somethingfishyfishy I think another concern would be performance and memory. Creating an enumeration with 10001 values (0 to 10000) would be extremely inefficient in terms of both memory usage and performance as compared as an if statement that checks if value between 0 and 10000. The extra memory is also not needed because each value from 0 to 10000 serves no other meaning besides representing the integer value, whilst enumeration is best used when each value has a distinct semantic meaning.

From what I can tell, every functionality works as intended. I like the unique UI and animation playing in the background, and automatic resizing also works, although can consider locking resizing of height due to the white bar. Maybe consider adding some way a user can quit the system other than outright closing the window with x button, but overall very impressive and good work. 👍

**1. :fas-info-circle: Question on how to integrate the GUI and CLI together for the iP**
</div>

Context:
My iP now supports operations from both the CLI and a GUI. Also, when I type the "bye" command in my CLI, while terminating the CLI, I can close the GUI window automatically as well. To implement both CLI and GUI simultaneously, I utilized The Java Thread class to create new threads.

Problem:
However, I am unable to do the same the other way around. When I close my GUI, I am unable to terminate the CLI automatically. I have a hunch that the thread running the GUI (thread 1) is unable to close the thread running the CLI (thread 2) as thread 2 has an active scanner that is actively waiting for a new line. I have tried ways to interrupt the scanner but I am still unable to solve the issue.

Looking for some advice on how to solve the problem of automatically terminating the CLI when closing the GUI window. Thank you for reading.

Hi prof,

Thank you for your quick response.

My rationale is more about learning and exploring the possibility of implementing both UIs, rather than practical reasons.

At the moment, the user cannot choose between the UIs, but I believe I can implement this functionality with relative ease.

**1. :fas-info-circle: GUI works when using ./gradlew run but not using IntelliJs play button**
</div>

Hi, I was able to set up my GUI a few days ago and run it just fine on IntelliJ.

However, I did some commits which added JavaDocs to my codebase and now it doesn't work when I run my Main class on IntelliJ. It only works I do ./gradlew run on the terminal. 

I have reverted my local copy to the commit in which it was previously working before, and I am still encountering the same issue. I'm puzzled because I did not edit anything in my codebase and my dependencies are the same, so I can't understand why it gives me the error that my JavaFX components are missing since the code is exactly the same and no dependencies have been changed.

Below is an attached screenshot of running my Main class with --stacktrace. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba19c51c-7d8a-4175-995d-4bf11af08d21)

Hi I faced this issue too but it works with this configuration

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd33fed6-137a-4a5a-9c38-eaeb3bdea553)

1. Under project structure -&gt; SDK, I chose the Zulu 17 version instead of OpenJDK 17. Previously I was using OpenJDK 17 also. Not super sure why it works but might be that OpenJDK 17 doesn't have JavaFX
2. If you want to use OpenJDK 17 version, go to Run -&gt; Edit Configurations  -&gt; Modify Options -&gt; Add VM options. Then add '--module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics' but change /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib to the path of where your JavaFX SDK libraries are located in your computer. Again not super sure why this works but if its because OpenJDK 17 doesn't have JavaFX, then this probably just specifies it.

Hi there, I used a Mac to test out your JAR file. Your README is informative and you went through the various functions. Just a little format issue for the tagging. As seen in the screenshot, I was able to tag without the # and it looked like i just added onto the previous tag. Not sure if this is something you may want to refine but overall I think the bot is working and nice!!

I think you need the isComplete method is for other class to check the status of current class and change the status of current class. Instead of exposing the isComplete method, I think can create a method automatically check complete and change the status of current class itself. Can you tell more detail about the context why you face this problem? Thank you.

However, after updating the "model" component of the tP, we realised that sending a PR to the team repo would mean that the PR would fail the test cases (since it is the updated version with new fields & functions and different argument orders for the already existing functions). 

Since we were taught to not merge PRs that fail test cases, what are the potential work arounds for this? Should one person edit all files required to remove/update all the new and unused classes and fields?

I am doing the Text UI Testing right now on a Windows computer. After setting up the runtest.bat, input.txt and EXPECTED.TXT, what should I do? 

I have tried running the runtest.bat file and it returns

'javac' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.


The same error message appears when I use cmd (inside and outside IntelliJ) to run the runtest.bat file. I have also tried troubleshooting online by adding the JDK bin folder into my system path variable and it still does not work.

> Hi since assert statements are meant for testing important assumptions that should already hold (potential errors should already be handled such that the assumptions should hold) should we catch it if it's actually thrown. 

I don't think assertions should be "caught". You want to find out whether or not assertions are actually true asap, you don't want to try stopping the assertions from telling you something is wrong with your code.

Raising errors/exceptions and assertions deal with different things.

From the course website:

> The raising of an exception indicates an unusual condition created by the user (e.g. user inputs an unacceptable input) or the environment (e.g., a file needed for the program is missing).
An assertion failure indicates the programmer made a mistake in the code (e.g., a null value is returned from a method that is not supposed to return null under any circumstances).

Hi, I'm on windows and it runs fine for me. Here are some bugs that i think can be improved relatively quickly:

- Calling delete on outOfBound Indexes (such as `delete -5`) will cause error messages to show on the terminal but nothing is shown on the GUI itself. 

- As shown in the image of the user guide, I think there is a typo here as it should be `t` to add ToDos instead of `d`.

**1. :fas-info-circle: Clarification on Forking Workflow for v1.2**
</div>

Hello Professors,

I would like to seek clarification regarding the forking workflow for our project in v1.2.

Our team has been divided into two sub-teams, one focusing on the UI and the other on the logic. To prevent potential conflicts, we are considering creating two separate branches from the master branch in our upstream repository—one for the UI team and another for the logic team. Each sub-team would then make their pull requests to their respective branches. This would allow us to isolate changes in each domain, and the master branch would remain untouched until we are ready to merge the two branches at the end of the cycle.

I wanted to confirm if this approach is allowed or recommended for our project as I have yet to see anything relating to branching from the upstream repo.

Thank you for your guidance!

I realise that the code works when I run the "run" task through the CLI, however it does not seem to be able to work by running the "run" task through the GUI. The code can be found in the branch-A-Gradle branch in my fork. Nontheless, since my code works through the CLI, and I am not editing my code using IntelliJ IDE, I will be closing the issue and sticking to the CLI to run gradle tasks.

IntelliJ has local history, right click on file, select local history as shown from option menu, click on show history and revert to your change. Note this is different from git and is IntelliJ's autosave feature. This saves all changes even uncommitted ones and shows all the way back to class creation. If you did not use the IDE to code, look for stashed changes and please start using the IDE in the future.

By default, Local History is configured to store revisions for the last 5 working days (that is, days when the file was modified). In the Settings dialog ( Ctrl Alt 0S ) , go to Advanced Settings. In the IDE section, provide the desired retention period value in the Duration of storing changes in Local History field.

Hi, it may seem that your output from the print is different compared to the expected output given by you, likely due to a missing newline at the end (remember that println will always end with a newline, however the expected test result is missing a final newline at the very end).

This is also evident from your output given:

>  3.[T][ ] read book> but was: &lt; Here are the tasks in your list that match book:

As you can see the ">" is on the same line as the output (whereas there is a blank line between the actual output and the final line, "Process...")

> 3.[T][ ] read book
> 
> Process finished with exit code -1

Do try this out and see if it works! Hope this helps!

Just to add on (for those not keen on using SDKMAN), you have to double check that you are downloading the FX variant under "Java Package" (especially if you are downloading manually)

<img width="209" alt="Screenshot 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cc829d1-8fc4-4d76-97e7-55905526068f"><br/>

Alternatively, the shortcut link is also given on the instructions page:

You may then just download the `.dmg` installer file and install right away, and this will set the default version of Java on your system to be Java 17 JDK+FX. Be sure to also choose the correct version for your platform (Intel macs: x86 64-bit, Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3: ARM 64-bit) 

Hope this helps!

I ran your jar file on macOS Ventura 13.5.2 and didn't encounter any errors. 
I played around a little bit and didn't encounter any crashes but here are some minor things you might want to take note of:

- error message formatting starts with `error: error: ` not sure if this is intended?

- Trying to delete a bad task number results in `an unexpected error occurred` but `task index out of range` may be a more useful error message

- input: `event NAME /to TODATE /from FROMDATE`
output: `... (from: TODATE to: FROMDATE)` which flips the two dates

Same here, I was thinking to use enum for the commands but Iater on I disagreed or something is missing because the command we type into the input is in String type, and there may be additional steps to check for correspondence between the enum type and String type?  We can do switch-case statement with string commands and have a default case to throw an exception, something like:

```
case "list":
    // whatever code logic
case "todo":
  // whatever code logic
default:
  // throw exception to show that command has been keyed in wrongly
```
which seems simpler than involving enum.
(so based on that thinking, I am also not sure how we can use enums as well)

**1. :fas-info-circle: Does it SLAP to use monads to abstract programming constructs?**

Hi everybody, we had learnt to abstract lines of code into a logical sequence of methods to achieve SLAP. I had noticed that my own code uses a lot of `if ( ) ``{`` ``}`` ... else ``{`` ``}``` or `try ``{`` ``}`` catch ( ) ``{`` ``}``` or the various loops. Will abstracting these constructs, say changing the conditional construct to `Conditional.of().ifBlock(&lt;condition>, &lt;method to execute>).elseBlock(&lt;method to execute>)` be following SLAP? Also, is doing this good practice?

I think `Ui` is for receiving input while `Parser` is for processing the input. For example, `Ui` might have a `readLine` method to receive input from the user, but it will pass the raw input to `Parser` to make sense of the input.

For me, my `Parser` class has a static method to parse the description of a task, and a static method to parse the slash arguments for a task. So, I would do something like this:
```
String description = Parser.parseDescription(input);
Map<String, String> arguments = Parser.parseArguments(input);
```
This extracts the values I need from the input line, and then I can do something else with those values.

Hi @gabriellegtw, not sure if this is directly related to your error, but your `application` in build.gradle is pointing to `Launcher` without the package. (I'm using terminal to run gradle so I'm unable to replicate the exact error)

You can try change to the following and see if the error still persist:
```java
application ``{``
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
``}``
```

Hope this helps.

Hi, if you want to disable Checkstyle checks, you can use build and exclude the Checkstyle tasks. Thus, you can try '''- name: Build with Gradle with Gradle run: ./gradlew build -x checkstyleMain -x checkstyleTest ''' -x checkstyleMain and -x checkstyleTest are used to exclude the Checkstyle tasks. These tasks might be named differently depending on your configuration, but checkstyleMain and checkstyleTest are the standard names for Checkstyle tasks in many setups. To verify task names, you can also run the following command locally to list all available tasks and their names: '''./gradlew tasks --all'''

I played around with SceneBuilder and managed to fix the same problem with my GUI, changing the preferred height of the HBox and Label to use computed size and the HGrow of the Label to "ALWAYS" seemed to fix it for me.

Hi, ran your jar file on my mac and everything looks good, just some small comments:
- Perhaps a help message could be included to list all possible commands.
- The positioning of text changes if the message is too long.
- There is an unknown error when the event /to date is after the /from date, perhaps an error message like "to date must be after from date" would be better?

I think the problem might be due to you connecting to your GitHub repo via the **HTTPS url** instead of the **SSH url**.
If the remote of your local repo is named **origin**, you can use the following command in your CLI to change the url of your remote to a new one. e.g the new url is **new.link/here**

Looks good! Just some minor formatting issues which I'm not sure if you want to address. Unfortunately I'm using Windows, as I don't use a Mac/Linux:

For the find function, there are no line breaks between the tasks being found, so everything appears in a single line:
![Screenshot 2024-09-20 142223](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a06a53c-ee33-495c-b4ca-8ecfd31349c9)

Also, the month in your expected output for the "delete" function on your user guide seems to be appearing a bit strangely. Again, a minor issue:

Lastly, just a suggestion but maybe you could add a link to your releases page in the "Quick Start" section in your user guide?

Other than that, everything seems to be working well!

> > For me I don't actually has method that print out different command error, I had a parent class for Exception (`ToothlessException`) and some inherited class that represent different type of error such as `MissingIndexException`, `MissingDescriptionException` and etc. Each has used the `super(String errorMessage)` in their own constructor to pass the error message to be printed. And I used `try` `catch` in my `main()` method to print the message from the exception via `e.getMessage()`. Not sure is this the best way to do it but it reduce the need to create lots of methods in the `Ui` class to print the messages. Hope it will helps!

Hi there! Yes, that would be how I implemented the exceptions too. If you have not added the JavaFX, it would be wherever you have your `while` loop. If you have added JavaFX, you could add the `try-catch` block in the `getResponse()` method and instead of printing, you can return the error message as a String. Both this method would allow you to continue using the application even after the error is thrown.

I believe you're right that related classes should be grouped into the same package. In your case, if you have an abstract class and three classes that extend it, it indeed does makes sense to bundle them together in one package since they share a common purpose or functionality. Creating a separate "exceptions" package for your exception classes is also another good way to organise your code.


> following the convention that files in the same package have to be of the same type

Regarding the above, I believe the convention that files in the same package have to be of the same "type" is more about maintaining logical cohesion rather than enforcing a strict rule so I would think that both your suggested ways of packaging your files would be acceptable so long as it makes logical sense.

For your 2nd question, I don't think every file needs to be in a package, but it's generally good practice to place all your classes, including your main executable (e.g. "Duke"), in packages to avoid naming conflicts and to better organize your code.

Regarding the error you got, yes I believe you are right that the error you're seeing is related to the change in the directory structure.. It seems like it happened because the references to your main class in other files (like `EXPECTED.TXT`, `README.md`, `runtest.bat`) would be outdated after moving it and need to be updated to reflect the new package structure. For example, if your class was previously referenced as `DGPT`, it would now need to be referenced as `main.DGPT` (if you put it in a package named `main`).

Hello, i did some simple testing and here are my comments!

Overall, the features all seem to work fine without any issues! However, here are some things that you may want to look into further! I have attached screenshots so that you may reproduce the steps I have taken. Hope this helps!

Pressing the send button creates empty chatboxes. May not be intended?

For event:
Keying in the wrong event format command produces the error "You are manipulating position out of bounds" which may not be an accurate error statement to display to users.

![event](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8f40de5-26e3-49e3-af8d-5ba1ac57a99b)

For deadline:
Similar to invalid event format command, the same error message is produced which may not be intended.

![deadline bot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/531b6536-aaeb-4a17-ba17-31f6b2b83b04)

Your user guide might have an slight typo: `deadlind `instead of `deadline`

![deadline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b88831e-b1f7-4701-9c15-038e1e536c8e)

Data storage:
Modifying the .txt file leads to the application not launching. Can possibly look into that if you have the time. (i.e. skip lines or produce error) See entry number 7, where the description is removed.

I think you can leave it as it is, as I won't consider that to be a magic literal. Magic literals (or strings) are defined as those whose meaning could not be understood without any additional context. 

In this case, the string: `I have sorted the list for you~ &hat;_&hat;\nThis is your new task list.` is quite self-explanatory as an output string, and anyone reading it will understand without prior context. Nonetheless, it doesn't hurt to declare it as a constant, and passing the constant as the parameter. 😄

Hi, windows user here! Looks mostly good to me, just a few suggestions:

1. Allow the user to enter timings in addition to just dates for deadlines and events, as this enhances the functionality of your bot. 
2. A welcome message would be good when the user enters the app. 
3. There can be a check to see if a user is marking/unmarking a task that has already been marked or unmarked respectively - reminding the user that they have already marked/unmarked the task. 
4. There can also be a check to see if the event start time is later than or equal to the event end time when adding a new event task.

The problem is that the team that opened issue #444 was deploying from master branch, while the image above is deploying from gh-pages branch, which by default does not have a /docs folder. This should be changed back to /[root] to avoid confusion (we were stuck on this for quite a bit haha)

Hi prof, 

I have a follow-up question on grading.
For milestone v1.2, we are expected to merge some code.
Is it ok to merge to a feature branch instead of the master branch in v1.2 as long as we merge the feature branch in v1.3?
Or will we be penalised because the grading script does not recognise other branches?

Thank you!

Hey y'all, I'm from the same team as @Jianwen0451 and we managed to fix the issue. We are pretty sure that we have set up the team repo correctly (codecov, tokens, repo settings and all that) but the Java CI just wasn't running.

Here's how we fixed it: 
1. Create a new workflow in GitHub Actions
2. Choose Java with Gradle
3. Rename the file to something else other than gradle.yml (gradletest.yml for example)
4. Copy and paste the content of gradle.yml into gradletest.yml
5. Commit to repo

After we did these steps, we had two Java CI's and they both started running. Now, we can disable the new Java CI workflow and the old one should now be functioning correctly. So basically, adding a new workflow kickstarted the Java CI.

As for what caused this issue in the first place, we have no clue.

Normally I would not recommend trying to fix it since it is pushed upstream. (Other people might be working on it)
But since this repo is just for you. 
1. Reset `branch-A-CodeQuality`'s `HEAD` by 1 (Undo merge of `master`)
2. Reset `master`'s `HEAD` by 2 (Undo merge of `branch-A-CodeQuality` and `branch-A-Assertions` into `master`)
3. Rebase `branch-A-Assertions` to the commit with tag `A-Checkstyle` (Makes the 2 branches parallel)
4. Merge the 2 branches into `master` 
5. Force push

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡 Branching: Ensure a merge commit is always created without fast-forwarding on mac**
</div>

Tip for macOS users:

I initially encountered an issue when trying to merge branch-Level-7 into master on my mac. The option to merge without fast-forwarding didn’t appear in the popup. After some some time I eventually discovered there's a default setting in Sourcetree that ensures all merges create a merge commit, preventing fast-forward merges.

To enable this setting:

1. Go to Sourcetree settings by using the shortcut (Command ,) or by selecting Sourcetree > Settings from the top menu bar

2. Navigate to the Git section

3. Tick the box "Do not fast-forward when merging, always create commit."

Hi, I tested it briefly on windows and all the basic features work fine.

Data saving and loading works and creating tasks works.
Only minor bug I encountered is using 'bye' command does not seem to do anything. You can interact with the chatbot perfectly fine after giving the 'bye' command.

Hi @rayray39, just had a few suggestions, but take note that this is just my opinion.
1.  It works great on windows, but perhaps you might want to create a subfolder named `data`and then place the `janet.txt` inside it. i.e. `data/janet.txt` is the path of the saved tasks file.
2.  Perhaps you can add the functionality of the chatbot exiting if the user types in the `bye` command.  You can try this by adding an exit animation. This is an excerpt from my code that tries to do it (although it can be cleaner) :
```java
    private void exitApplicationWithDelay(double seconds) ``{``
        PauseTransition delayAnimation = new PauseTransition(Duration.seconds(seconds));
        delayAnimation.setOnFinished(event -&gt; Platform.exit());
        delayAnimation.play();
    ``}``
    private void handleUserInput() ``{``
    ...
      if (response.equals("EXIT MESSAGE")) ``{``
              dialogContainer.getChildren().addAll(
                      encloseUserInput(input),
                      encloseNedInput(ned.getByeMessage(), false));
              exitApplicationWithDelay(2);
              return;
          ``}``
   ``}``
```

Overall, good job!

Hey! I am a windows user, everything seems great on my end, I tried using an invalid date: 2019-99-99 and even though the bot didn't respond, it could still function afterwards so really good error handling!

All the commands work well and the GUI is pretty dope, only problem I faced was with this error, I am guessing you used scene builder to customise the GUI, and didn't change the JavaFX version back as scenebuilder will auto modify the JavaFX version in your .fxml files to use Java version 22 by default

Great job!

I think the issue is with the java version. Ensure your java version is correct by doing `java -version` as referenced by this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html). If you installed java with sdkman, the issue is with the java source path.

Try running this command: `source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"`. If it works, append this line to your config by doing `echo source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh" >> ~/.zshrc` (it looks like you are using zsh shell)

It formats as intended when `switch` is the first keyword in the line, but still force indent otherwise. Is there any way to get around this in intellij?

**1. :fas-info-circle: 💡 Custom/External Fonts in JavaFX via CSS**
</div>

Was pretty frustrating to figure out, with ChatGPT + Internet searches giving confusing contradicting info, so here's what worked for me if anyone wants to know:

---

### 1. Get your font files

Generally of the filetypes `.otf` or `.ttf`. Create a new folder `fonts` in your `src/main/resources` directory. Place the files there.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb7a9008-046a-409d-a3a1-faab1de60ddb)

### 2. Load fonts

In your `Main` class, or whatever extends `Application` and is where your GUI runs from, import

```java
import javafx.scene.text.Font;
```

And add the following in the constructor:

```java
Font.loadFont(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/fonts/<font-filename>"), v);
```

- Replace `<font-filename>` with the filename of the font you want to use, e.g. `comic.ttf` that is present in `resources/fonts`. 
- `v` is the default font size.

### 3. Add fonts to CSS

Whenever you specify a font in CSS, simply replace that string with the name of the font you have loaded. 
```css
.button ``{``
    ...
    -fx-font: bold 16px "Comic Sans MS";
    ...
``}``

.text-field ``{``
    ...
    -fx-font-family: "Montserrat SemiBold";
    ...
``}``
```

#### Note:

You might want to check the exact name of the font, since it can be different from the filename of that font. Make sure in the CSS sheet you use the **actual name** (e.g. `Montserrat SemiBold` or `Comic Sans MS`) and not the **filename** (`Montserrat-SemiBold` or `comic`).

You can obtain the names by:

```java
Font font1 = Font.loadFont(getClass().getResourceAsStream("/fonts/Inter-Medium.ttf"), 18); // load font from file
font1.getName(); // gets you name of the font
```

### Voila!

You can now show off to ~~the world~~ your teammates your excellent taste in font choice.

Hi, I'm a Windows user, works well for me too! 

Just to check, is the `bye` command supposed to do anything? When I tried it, it showed the exit message but didn't automatically exit the application. Is closing the application window with X the only way to exit the application?

Otherwise, all other features work as intended. Great job with the UI as well! :)

Hi, good job on your IP! I'm a windows user but I thought I'll still help test things out. Mostly everything looks good to me, except when I use the unmark command, the formatting of the response appears to be slightly off. Also, when adding a task with dates, it appears that I can set the date to be anything, even strings like "tomorrow" or empty strings. It might be good to fix this before the final submission. All the best!

It looks good in my OS(window), but just that the program does not handle non-positive value like if I type 
`mark 0`, it caused a java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException in the terminal but it was not reflected in the chatbot.

Hi, just tried out your chatbot v1.1. No issues on windows end. (Also, it looks awesome). I tested also reopening it to see if the data is persistent and it is.   

I would say the only small issue I had is that when I type a command in an incorrect format it says Danger, invalid command format but it does not tell me the format I should use.

Hi, everything looks great on my end on Windows. Maybe you could introduce a bit of personalization and their were a couple of minor errors such as for the command 'list -1', the bot would still print out the list. In the case for 'delete -1', I was unable to send the message.

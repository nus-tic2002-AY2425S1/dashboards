> If we work under the assumption that each Company will only have one person in charge, we can simply use a `Person` object.

Perhaps we could consider using UniquePersonList class and allow any number of liaises, but this is definitely no a high priority change since it is not essential to the core functionality of company (payroll purpose)

Just a nitpick, you can just resolve it if you disagree my suggestion. 

I know this command is grammatically correct, but I have concern about the consistency of our commands, because for the rest of the command, it is always "company" (e.g. `delete company`) right? 

Unless we are thinking of implement different type of behavior based of the if the target is singular or plural (for example, `delete company` deletes one company while `delete companies` delete multiple companies), I think it is better to stick to the same style.

I just realized that your `Company::equals` does not behave like `Person::equals`. Perhaps for consistency sake, and to prevent potential confusion in the future, can you implement `Company::isSameCompany` and make `Company::equals` behave similarly to `Person::equals`?

For consistency sake, I would suggest changing the public variable name of all fields to `value`. So in this case, `fullName` and `date` -&gt; `value`. 

I know `Person`'s `Name` uses `fullName` as its public variable name as well, but to me it does not make sense to name it other than `value` if `Name` class only has one variable anyways.

Wait so currently we can't create a job without specifying requirements and description?

I do think requireNonNull() should be included just to be safe, because theoretically the caller of this method can just pass in Null, causing error when trimming. 

What I wanted to check is that, what would optional arguments be stored as in json if we do not specify them in command.

You are right, now that I think about it, this is probably because this exception is an unchecked/runtime exception and the program is not expected to recover from it, so no friendly error message is needed.

Actually, this is because Ze Wei had to merge Jun Boon and Alek's changes to his branch as he had to build on top of their code. 

So we have to wait for Jun Boon and Alek's PR to be merged to master, before (hopefully) this PR only capture Ze Wei's changes.

the reason is that its increasing code complexity right now. I think it would be better if we just enforced that gradelevel followed a regex of '[Exam board] [number]' (see other model classes for the validation format). If needed in the future, then the granular information can be retrieved with a new method. I think it is cleaner than having extra attributes

Stylistically, I think the two `VBox`s you added should have the style class of `pane-with-border`. Then the outer one just needs the background (like the `stack-pane` style class). Then add some spacing in between:

Yep it's ok to follow the previous code, but I think there's no need for the parent `HBox` to have the width when the child `VBox` already has a width of 340.

It is a desktop app. The implementation of this could be integration with WhatsApp Web/Telegram Web or some sort of VoIP.

Of course, we won't be doing it in this project. I can remove it if we decide that we want the user stories to represent things that we are more likely to actually do in the project.

It might make more sense to end the use case here instead of looping back to step 1 of the MSS.

It might be better to omit this step as it is not externally visible to the user. The extensions for this step should definitely stay, but can be tagged to step 1 instead.

You might want to omit "in the correct format" and move it to an extension. The extension would then handle situations where the command was incorrectly formatted.

By specifying that the event name and date are in the correct format, it might imply that steps 2a and 2b are redundant as:
- correct format
- event name invalid
- date format invalid

appear to contradict each other.

I would argue that this feature should be renamed to "filter vendors by rating" with the benefit "avoid working with less reputable vendors" instead.

The term "block" does not mean much in the context of the application—there is no two-sided interaction within the application. 

As the application is meant to help the event planner, it would make sense to keep this feature for tracking purposes, but it could be renamed to better reflect the intent of this "blocking" functionality.

"add a vendor" might be too similar (and possibly ambiguous) to the next user story of assigning vendors. Perhaps consider phrasing it in a similar way to line 303 to be something like:
- create a new vendor

Grammar—change "upcomings" to "upcoming" as adjectives do not have plural endings in English.

Also consider:
- use "track" instead of "see" in the benefit
- omit "in my schedule" entirely

The terms "see" and "schedule" might imply some form of calendar visualisation, which is already covered by the user story in line 320.

Renaming this might help to make the user story more concise and helps to keep the benefit relevant to the feature described.

Should we remove the import, and instead change the comment instead? Because the import is redundant without the comment. We could instead adopt a comment similar to that found in ParseException.
```
/**
 * Represents a parse error encountered by a parser.
 */
 ```
 Another option would be to adopt a stance similar to AddressBookStorage
 ```
 /**
 * Represents a storage for ``{``@link seedu.address.model.AddressBook``}``.
 */
 ```
I prefer the latter, as it removes the import statement, yet still maintains the link. I believe the choice remains with you though, since you're the main person managing code quality. Just some food for thought.

Just a nit, persons should change to students. Although I recognize that many of the methods in this class remain as Persons, which I believe to be a deliberate choice, the name of the class is also called Unique*Student*List, and I believe at least the comments in the class should reflect that consistently, as you have already done for the other methods.

Would it be better to mention that ContactCS displays a message to the user saying that currently there's no contact/the list is empty etc? Because we are expected to handled things gracefully and provide clues to the user if there's no response from the system/operation fail due to whatever errors

This part seems to be a bit vague, as in it is not very clear when is the user supposed to provide ContactCS with the information to update the conact. Perhaps it would be better to add in a bit more detail like `User requests to update contact info of a specific person using the given information` or something?

Not sure if this is a good idea, refer to [tP constraints - Recommendation-Minimal-Network](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-constraints.html#recommendation-minimal-network) for more detail. Btw, since the auto-open of outlook is classified as unlikely to have, maybe this part of use case is not really needed?

Sorry I am a bit confused, it seems like previous use cases mentioned error message shown when missing email for contact creation, in that case would such issue be triggered? Perhaps it would be better this issue in two possible ways?
1. Classify email as not compulsory field and remove checking of email from previous use cases
2. Or, remove this use case if this would not happen at all as long as email for contacts guarantee to exist

I think the step numbers are wrong for add contact use case extensions, the checks for valid format & emails are in step 2 hence extensions based on this step should be 2.*(For example, 2a, 2b, 2c etc.) You may refer here for correction:

Edited: Also I realize, it looks weird and doesn't make sense to extend from step 3 and resumes from step 2, I guess you may just be confused about the numbering, so should definitely take note for rest of the parts as well, thanks

Personally I prefer keeping the user story but deleting such use case, because user story is optional to implement but use case is really specifying what our system can do and it will serve as a more detailed requirement specification which we would need when developing the actual product ourselves.

PS: Sorry if there's confusion but I was trying to say that our user story for opening outlook is classified as unlikely-to-have, not from the tP-constraints, sorry for the confusion

It seems like I can't merge this directly after any approval because the new code added decreased the coverage level of the existing test cases, but I have found similar issues [Codecov test failing](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/325) and according to the prof response, we can try resolve this by:
1. Decrease the the code coverage limit, which probably need someone with write access to help(@weiseng18)
2. Write test cases to cover this part of the code(but I don't think there's anyway to do that, since there's nothing to test).

So, I am proposing a decrease of coverage limit to pass this PR(Since this week is more about tweaking the code instead of actually implementing the functions, writing test cases may not be possible and this issue may easily be triggered by others as well when doing this week's tasks)

Edit: Can refer to prof's latest reply [here](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2425S1/forum/issues/474), I think whoever has admin access can merge the CI-failing PR also, but lowering codecov limit may still be desired if such issue is triggered   too often

I think this is a fair point, we could change it to give a warning instead of outright rejection, as there are cases of customers who may reside in Singapore but primarily overseas.

Maybe add a test for this? like `toModelType_invalidPaymentStatus_throwsIllegalValueException`

Let's try to keep it case-insensitive. Simplest way is to just do `userinput.toLowerCase()` when taking the value from the user.

I think the original idea was to have different vendor categories (catering, flowers, etc.) then you can keep track of the category/aspect that have been satisfied by a vendor of that type. 

however that might be too ambitious in hindsight I think Bo Chang proposed change would be good

Commit didn't fully explain the changes, besides removing email model I have rename all address model to description.

description does not allow an empty however there's a alternative constructor in vendor model that does not takes in description and set it to a Description model object with string val "-". 
Would like to change this to an optional&lt;desceription> implementation however it seems it would require alot more changes which might not be in the scope of this issue.

Would be good if our feature specification is updated to reflect the change in the commands, as well as the prefix name change.

Another food for thought is whether we should change all the commands from `&lt;command>&lt;space>&lt;target>` to `&lt;command>_&lt;target>` as what you have done here

For `appointmentList`,  are you planning to make it such that the user can choose to also input the patient's appt using the existing `t/` tag prefix when adding the patient and it will get parsed by `parseappointment` and only added if it is a valid appointment?

If not, should we set  `appointmentList` to be an empty set first? So that the `Person` object will be initialise with no appts.

I think this might have too many details in terms of what the user inputs with the command (like contact index and email address) based on some of the examples we got in textbook and the AddressBook user guide (one textbook example for an action in the MSS was just "3. User enters the requested details." so I don't think info regarding the type of details/inputs is required)

I think for the commands where the user needs to add something for an existing contact, need to specify that the user must first find them (the DG task for this week says e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)), so can potentially follow format given in AddressBook use cases:

*MSS*
1. User requests to list persons
2. AddressBook shows a list of persons
3. User requests to delete a specific person in the list
4. AddressBook deletes the person

If you end up using the way of detailing MSS where you have the first 2 steps of requesting to see the list of persons, in these extensions can have instead of 'The use case ends.' something like 'Use case resumes at step 2.' Example given in AddressBook user guide for one extension is:


> 3a. The given index is invalid.
> 
>  3a1. AddressBook shows an error message.
> 
> Use case resumes at step 2.

it looks like you're not allowing duplicate prefixes, so can users not create multiple tags in one create-tag command? if you're using the prefix_tag to separate different tags, wouldn't it not be a concern to separate the different tags and then be able to have multiple tags in the create-tag command?

I could be misunderstanding this but if `argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS).isPresent()` is `true`, then `editPersonDescriptor.setAddress(ParserUtil.parseAddress(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS).orElse("")))` will always return the `argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS)` value, even if it is a blank string (ie: redundency...?).

Isn't this use case the same as 1a? Since the only time an error detection is made is when the user sends the command? Either ways, i do not think this should be a "at any time" kind of extension.

What i meant to say is should it remain as "resume at step 2"? Since this extension would return back to the MSS after a user inputs the right command.

I think the response for when the list is empty is handled by the `list persons` use case. As for delete, I would think that the user attempting to delete a person from an empty list is technically index out of bound (aka invalid), thus this extension covers it.

@MAOXIONGKAI Thanks for discovering the stem of the issue.

Before revising code, I would like to know how everyone would like our product to behave here.
I suggest the following (Referring to the two scenarios mentioned above):
**for scenario 1:**
Directly reject inputs with at least one empty keyword like `find n/` because it is meaningless. We keep the guard clause within `FindCommandParser.parse()` for this case.

**For scenario 2,**
Allow multi-word keywords. Additionally,
An entry matches a multi-word keyword $keyword_1 keyword_2 \cdots keyword_n$ iff its name $name$ satisfies $\forall i, name.contains(keyword_i)$. In other words, every word in the keyword must be present consecutively in the name, but not necessarily as a full word.

**examples**
Name: `Zhu Tianyi`
|Input|Result|
|------|------|
|`find n\ n\Zhu`|error|
|`find n\Zhu Tian`|match|
|`find n\Tianyi Zhu`|match|
|`find n\Tian Zhu`|match|
|`find n\yiTian`|does not match|


Any alternative suggestion is welcome!

i think i agree, let's avoid interfacing with external stuff if possible. specifically, if we can leave this out then let's do that

we could still make sending emails somewhat seamless if we have like a "copy to clipboard" button instead!

The comment on the constructor here says that every field must be present and not null. At the start of the constructor, there is also a `requireAllNonNull` that includes the `address` param, so it might be a bit weird in this case

Two ideas:
1. Remove `address` from `requireAllNonNull`. Then I would think that the `address` parameter to this constructor should be `Optional&lt;Address>`.
2. Create a new constructor that does not have `address` as a parameter

Currently the message constant is "The person index provided is invalid". Since we error if any of the indices are out of bounds, then maybe we can change this to "One of the person indices provided is invalid", or create a new message constant

`MESSAGE_DELETE_PERSON_SUCCESS` seems to be designed to be used with `String.format` for a single person, so maybe might want to look into changing this.

We could simply change it to `Deleted Person(s): %1$s\n`, for example

- Perhaps the changes above are not really needed, as we are essentially still working with a model of an address book.. (plus quite some changes affected the intended meaning of some statements, e.g., a person's address -&gt; a person's researchroster) what do the rest think!
- Suggestion: can instead change the app's name displayed on our GUI (the one that'll appear on the top of the window)!

This issue has been fixed. However, if requirements/description is too long and the GUI isn't expanded, some of the words are hidden until you scroll horizontally. 

Also, within the `JobCard`, a minor aesthetic change can be implemented so that it displays $2500 instead of 2500, but I didn't include it in this PR for now. See if this 'fix' is wanted.

I'll be honest, I have no idea why `requireNonNull()` is utilized, as including it or not doesn't result in the app breaking (and the displayed text is the same). I mainly added it to be consistent with the existing code base. 

 Prior to calling the methods in `parserUtil`, usually the input goes through `ArgMultiMap`, where we then use `ArgMultiMap.getValue(PREFIX).get()`. However, `getValue(PREFIX)`, in the event a PREFIX doesn't exist, returns an `Optional.empty()` and calling `get()` on that returns an `Exception`, so perhaps it has something to do with that? 

An alternative explanation could also be that this `requireNonNull()` serves as an `assert` statement.

Oh that was what you meant XD. 

Yea, I have identified that as a bug but also at the same time, it is also because I am currently using `requirements` and `description` which might be replaced by `tags`. So I'm holding off on fixing the bug until I am clearer on what the feature spec should be.

Marking this as resolved for now.

I see, so really the 2 parameters `exit` and `showHelp` seem to just be for the `exit` and `help` command.

I believe your PR is forked off one of the 2 earliest PRs, so it reflects 30 changed files, which makes it hard to do a review.  

**After the earlier PRs are merged**, I recommend this next series of steps. If I made any mistake and there are other alternatives, please sound out! 

Note that I am assuming terminal usage within IDEA and not SourceTree. 

1. Pull from this repo to your local master branch (`git pull remote master`), this command might not work if you did not set your upstream to be this repo
2. Change to your working branch (`git checkout branch-delete-company`)
3. Merge your local master branch to your working branch (`git merge --no-ff master`)
4. Resolve any merge conflicts that arise
5. After the merge is complete, push your working branch to your own repo (`git push origin branch-delete-company`)
6. There is a chance that the files changes might still be 30, as was the case with one of my closed PRs. In that case, close this PR and open a new one, and it should reflect the actual changed files.

I have completed this, in my branch - `branch-delete-job`, which utilises the "delete_job" format. However, as I noted that we might want to implement "delete &lt;Mode>" instead, I held off on the PR for this round and await the next one.

Had the same idea, but went through with following the standard convention of other classes under model/person where all the values are public. Had I set it to private my getters would have to be different name as we would then need 2 getters to get the actual priority in String format (i.e first getter to get Priority class object from Person object, then second getter to get the String value) making the test cases less comprehensible, as such decide to go with the flow to ensure readability as well as standardizations throughout test cases.

Also in Person class , the Priority variable is Private final already, so it is not that detrimental to set priority's own variable to be public to reduce having 2 getters with similar names.

When we amend a particular parameter of the Person , we create a new instance of the person as the variables are immutable. If you would like to assign/change the priority of an existing person, you must create a new instance of it with the same variables as it was before with the exception of the variable you are changing, hence the getters. Hope this clarifies.

im not very sure for this but would it be better if the system validates input format first? cos im not very sure what does validates input mean. i think it makes more sense for validating input to be checking for duplicates and if that is the case then u need to shift up 6a alr.

Personally I would retain `tags` instead of renaming the variable to `tagged` since we are referring to a list of tags. `tagged` doesn't quite imply list of tags - I would infer it to be a `boolean` variable (although `isTag` better implies `boolean` i know)

This is following the coding style and methods of other Person detail classes. Further, the conditional cases here is to allow for 2 checks for validation of date, where date could be due to poor formatting, or invalid dates like 30 feb, where isValidDate() could then return separate errors for each.

The way I'm thinking of doing this is similar to the way it is being done for `Storage`:
# Interface + Implementation of separate models:
Add an `interface` to the current model abstraction chain, similar to what's being done for storage:
```java
/**
 * Represents a storage for ``{``@link AddressBook``}``.
 */
public interface AddressBookStorage ``{``
...
``}``

/**
 * A class to access AddressBook data stored as a json file on the hard disk.
 */
public class JsonAddressBookStorage implements AddressBookStorage ``{``
...
``}``
```
```java
/**
 * Represents a storage for ``{``@link UserPrefs``}``.
 */
public interface UserPrefsStorage ``{``
...
``}``
/**
 * A class to access UserPrefs stored in the hard disk as a json file
 */
public class JsonUserPrefsStorage implements UserPrefsStorage ``{``
...
``}``
```
## Merged Storage object
We use these interfaces to create a new Mother-of-all `Model` interface, which we implement as `ModelManager`, which can be initialised with instances of `AddressBookModel` and `TransactionBookModel`.

Here is how `Storage` does it:
```java
/**
 * API of the Storage component
 */
public interface Storage extends AddressBookStorage, UserPrefsStorage ``{``
...
``}``
public class StorageManager implements Storage ``{``
    // Initialise with instance of each storage
    private AddressBookStorage addressBookStorage;
    private UserPrefsStorage userPrefsStorage;

    // Expose all methods from all storages
    @Override
    public Optional<UserPrefs> readUserPrefs() throws DataLoadingException ``{``
        return userPrefsStorage.readUserPrefs();
    ``}``
    @Override
    public Optional<ReadOnlyAddressBook> readAddressBook(Path filePath) throws DataLoadingException ``{``
        return addressBookStorage.readAddressBook(filePath);
    ``}``
...
``}``
```

Sure we can explore better implementation for this in future iterations and potentially refactor the ab3 code as well. The current implementation takes the form from `java/spleetwaise/address/logic/commands/ClearCommand.java`

```
public class ClearCommand extends Command ``{``

    public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "clear";
    public static final String MESSAGE_SUCCESS = "Address book has been cleared!";


    @Override
    public CommandResult execute(Model model) ``{``
        requireNonNull(model);
        model.setAddressBook(new AddressBook());
        return new CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS);
    ``}``
``}``
```

From a software engineering perspective, the decision to abstract exceptions should be guided by principles like DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and maintainability. If both the address and transaction commands share similar behaviour in their exception handling, it might indeed make sense to introduce a more generic CommandException class. This would allow for more consistent handling and reduce code duplication across different modules.

However, we should also consider the potential for future expansion. The requirements for exception handling are likely to diverge significantly between address and transaction commands in the future, having separate exception classes might provide us with greater flexibility. In this case, we could follow the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), ensuring that the system can be extended without modifying existing code. This should be in line with our initial rationale for creating the `spleetwaise.transaction` packages. 

More importantly, using specific exceptions can enhance the clarity and precision of test cases. When testing, it allows us to accurately capture and handle the expected errors that relate specifically to transactions. This level of specificity is crucial in unit tests, where we aim to validate not just the occurrence of an error, but its precise nature and context. It ensures that our tests are robust and correctly reflect the application’s behaviour in different scenarios.

I am closing this as it does not make sense in real-life situations. If a person does not pay the money owed, we will usually just delete the contact and cut off all contacts in real life.

> Hi @AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/developers, for GUI testing, thinking of using [TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library, then test for each command, the output in `resultDisplayPlaceholder`, `personListView`, `transactionListView` are displayed correctly. In doing so, the testing should go through all the required components and ticked off code coverage issues. So no need _'unit testing'_ each individual components like `TransactionCard`, `TransactionListPanel` that is not helpful.

> * [ ]  a test case on `adjustPaneVisibility` in `MainWindow.java`

[TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) is in line with what the CS2103 textbook recommends. Unless you want to learn selenium. Else we can go ahead with testFX

I'm not certain how regex works, whether its case insensitive or not, but we should make the majors case insensitive since it's what we wrote in the feature list, and I think it's reasonable to have it be case insensitive.

same thing, I think we need to make the validation case insensitive but make it be displayed as 'brUdder' or 'mUdder' only. Otherwise, it'll be an inconvenience for the users.

Just wondering, while I don't think we need to cater to every user's possible needs or even mistakes, if our command is 
`schedule (id) /start (some time) /end (some time) /location (some place)`
then isn't is quite understandable if the user double spaces after typing location? Shouldn't we just trim the string? and thus removing the need to regex the location string of a leading whitespace?

The plan is to have the Ui mock-up be updated along with the existing commits in this pull request so as to allow us to easily keep track of the changes made for the same purpose.

Update: We've instead decided to have the Ui mock-up be updated as a separate PR. Will instead be looking to merge this PR first.

Here's my suggestion for NFR and Glossary
```markdown
### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should respond to user commands without noticeable lag for most operations.
5. The application should allow for seamless data export in common formats (e.g., CSV or JSON) for external backup or sharing.

---

### Glossary

- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS.

I found that using local paths causes a bug that doesn't let the image render, so maybe we should use the generated asset link: https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w14-4.github.io/tp/images/leowolf275.png ?

Also maybe we should add alt text for accessibility or see whether there's an issue in the image rendering? Here's an example:
`<img src="https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w14-4.github.io/tp/images/youngseopark05.png" alt="Youngseo Park's picture" width="200px" />`

I see, but in our case since we are referencing UC01 List all contacts use case,

> **Use case: UC01 -  List all contacts**
> 
> **MSS**
> 
> 1.  User issues the list command.
> 2.  The system retrieves and displays the list of all contacts to the user.

I think there should not be a repeat of step 2 saying the system displays a list of all contacts (Like in the example), in other use cases.

> **Use case: UC05 - Add Email to Contact**
> 
> **MSS**
> 
> 1. User &lt;ins>lists all contacts (UC01)&lt;/ins>.
> 2. User issues the add-email command with the corresponding details. 
> 3. The system adds the email address to the contact and displays a success message
> 4. The system displays the updated contact information in the address book.

as such, I think in the extension it will look like this. I will clarify if this is correct, but for now this will be the changes before any further clarification is made. Thanks for pointing that out

I am not very sure about this, but based on the logic for this use case, the user cannot stop until a profile is successfully added.

Thanks for your feedback about the auto-open feature for Outlook! I see where you’re coming from, especially with the tP constraints saying it’s unlikely to have.

The changes inlude:
1. Continue requesting the user to key in the correct format of the input when the input from the user is not valie
2. Continue requesting the user to key in all the required fields when the fields are not complete
3. Add a message displaying the list is empty
4. Split the redo/undo action into two use cases
5. Remove the use cases for the automatically saving and loading function

Things to note:
- Uncertain about the action to be taken for the use case of opening the email in Outlook.

If we are to delete 'DeleteCommand.java' file, I think it will be optimal to also remove line 62-63
'case DeleteCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
return new DeleteCommandParser().parse(arguments); '

I can see a potential error here. I think we need to implement a prefix to differentiate between index and phone number.

I don't think this method will work with higher number of index such as 2024 because parsePhone check if the digit is at least 3 digit long.

I think we just leave it for now, can discuss further on Sunday.

The current idea I have in mind is adding prefixes. For example, the command is able to parse all the prefixes and the user have to supply a minimum of 1 prefix and value such as delete i/[index].

When the user write delete n/John a/nus lmao, it will narrow the delete and I think this prefix mechanism can be extended further for batch delete and such.

Actually since there is only one `personList` to store all persons with roles here, does it actually offer any performance gain compared to the `filteredList`, since in the long run they seem quite similar, but I think its useful for now to prevent duplicates?

Additional task:
3. Implement "2 word" constraint for name field (for add command). Inside `Name.java` can replace the `VALIDATION_REGEX` with `[\\p``{``Alnum``}``]+ [\\p``{``Alnum``}``][\\p``{``Alnum``}`` ]*`.
4. Update `MESSAGE_CONSTRAINT` to reflect the above validation. (should cover both "2 word" and "special char" constriants)

I am wondering if this Fee should be _abstract_? Or are there any cases when the Fee class can be used directly?
for the testing part, I think an anonymous class can be created for testing non-abstract methods
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class AbstractClassTest ``{``

    @Test
    public void testNonAbstractMethod() ``{``
        AbstractClass abstractClass = new AbstractClass() ``{``
            @Override
            public void abstractMethod() ``{``
                // No implementation needed for the test
            ``}``
        ``}``;
        
        String result = abstractClass.nonAbstractMethod();
        assertEquals("Hello from non-abstract method!", result);
    ``}``
``}``

Repeat 3a1 to 3a3 until data entered is correct.

Edit `addAssignmentCommand` to ensure that a new `Assignment` can only be created with an existing `Student` being assigned to it. 

More details:
- Remove the `Score` functionality
- Add a "details" field to the assignment 
- Assignment should have a simple boolean on whether the `Assignment` has been submitted by the student

so like in the production code, it uses `UuidProvider` which is an interface with `uuid()` method. 
Inject `UuidProvider.Fake` in your tests, and `RandomUuidProvider` in your production code.

I think of other implementation, still holds a reference to address book, on interface `Parser` instead (similar to [Model](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/spleetwaise/address/model/Model.java)). Depends on how often model is used.
How it works:
- `getPersonFromPhone(Phone phone)` becomes `getPersonFromPhone(Phone phone, model)`
- `AddCommandParser` calls `getPersonFromPhone(Phone phone, model)`
- Since `AddCommandParser` implements `Parser&lt;AddCommand>`, can access the model variable. The other parsers can use the model variable as well.

Hi @AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-1/developers, for GUI testing, thinking of using [TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library, then test for each command, the output in `resultDisplayPlaceholder`, `personListView`, `transactionListView` are displayed correctly. In doing so, the testing should go through all the required components and ticked off code coverage issues. So no need _'unit testing'_ each individual components like `TransactionCard`, `TransactionListPanel` that is not helpful.

TODO (after completion of `AddTxn` and `ListTxn` command):
- [ ] GUI testing for add txn then output correctly for both big screen and split screen
- [ ] a test case on `adjustPaneVisibility` in `MainWindow.java`

Can refer to ParserUtil.parseTags, issue with parseTags is it currently takes in a List&lt;String> which only has 1 string, inside with the whole text after t/ e.g. t/ tag1 tag2 will result in a List&lt;String> with 1 string "tag1 tag2". This gets rejected by the validation regex for tags as it does not allow spaces

While this isn’t necessarily an issue, it’s worth mentioning that `java.util` also has a `Calendar` class. This could potentially lead to naming conflicts or confusion down the line. Would you consider renaming the class with a prefix? For example, you could use a name like `EdulogCalendar` (a bit verbose, i know)

Consider using `List&lt;Lesson>` instead of `ArrayList&lt;Lesson>` when declaring the lessons variable. It might give us greater flexibility and allow us to change the implementation later without affecting the rest of the code. It also adheres to best practices by promoting abstraction. We can still instantiate it as an `ArrayList` or another List type as needed.

RequireNonNull will throw a null pointer exception if the argument is null. Have you accounted for the handling of this null pointer exception? Perhaps assertion statement could be a plausible solution if you want to stop execution of the program.

On a side note, one highly relevant NFR could be creating security measures around the patients' data, since this kind of information is quite sensitive under PDPA. In my opinion, basic encryption and decryption could be implemented, but at the same time it can also be considered somewhat unreasonable to implement since it is out of the scope of what we're supposed to do.

Just a nice-to-have, maybe something we can do if we have extra time.

```
> ### Non-Functional Requirements

> 1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
> 2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
> 3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

It looks good! One note is that the phone number in this test case is not 8 digits long like specified in the feature specification document. 

I actually added the constrain of 8 digit long phone numbers in PR #44 as well as changed all the sample Person objects to have 8 digit phone numbers. So this test case might fail once that is merged.

Actually I am not sure if we are supposed to use the class name (`AddressBook`) for use cases. If there is no need to use class names, ConTActs makes sense. Maybe @DKHB0207 @sayglenn @yockcheng can help us out here.

Upon further revision, I realise that this PR tried to introduce too many changes too soon. I believe that many of the changes eg. end time, location are useful to have, but should be held off until a later iteration.

Have reduced the scope of this PR to just the name and date fields to match the feature specification for now. Can always refer to the commit history when implementing new features in the future.

I'm not sure if there is a better implementation, but since Transaction relies on the Person object and the add command uses Phone as input, `getPersonFromPhone` was created to find the corresponding Person in the address book. The upside of this approach is that we do not have to chain address book in the transaction command chain, but the downside is that this might feel out of place since `ParserUtil` now holds on to a reference to the existing address book

Took a quick run through the changes. This is just my two cents, but I think it would be better to build the smaller component parts without adding partially implemented functions in the bigger components with TODOs. This would help distinguish between components that are ready and those that are not ready.

deletecommand is an abstract class so it no longer can be created as an object. But I made a mistake here as it is too specific to contact when the comment should be more general like "subclass of deletecommand". I will rectify this. thank you

Oh, it was from my auto-formatter, which was used to format the table in the developer guide. Changed to `*` to be consistent with the rest for now. Maybe we could standardize which to use in another pull request.

Currently, appointment is deemed as an optional field, as not all patients may have an appointment.

For patients without appointments, their appointment variable holds a null value. With this implementation, `appointment.equals(otherPerson.appointment)` will trigger a NullPointerException if `appointment` is null. Using Object.equals() helps to prevent that. 

I am also not too sure if this is the best way to go about doing it, can discuss?

test cases not edited, will need to do that. Think I need to wait for David's and Aaron's Owner and Pet classes to be merged in before I can do any more edits. This commit mainly allows PawPatrol to understand the new delete and list commands, for example "delete p11" to mean delete the pet with index 11.

I think these are required to provide clarity as they may have ambiguous meanings. 

For example, archive could mean to set all existing information to an archived tag in the application, while in reality it deletes everything and stores the old data. Which might be similar to export but is not of the same function.

![屏幕截图(91)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b733f491-fc95-48a3-95b1-a4307336910d)

Next steps:
1. Remove irrelevant fields (phone number, address)
2. Make some fields optional (I think I've indicated this in the code, but there still seem to be some issues)
3. Fix the commented-out test cases
4. Refine the constraints for each field

LGTM. However, there is a checkstyle error: 
[ERROR] /home/runner/work/tp/tp/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java:8:8: Unused import - seedu.address.logic.Messages. [UnusedImports]
After correcting this, should be good to merge!

the gradlew test doesn't allow this tip poping out function to be in delete command class, instead it should be in a javafx file I don't know how to solve this so commented this part of code so far, try to solve it the next time
